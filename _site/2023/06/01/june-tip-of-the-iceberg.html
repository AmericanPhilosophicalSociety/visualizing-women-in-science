    <p>Deb Niemeier uses civil engineering to advocate for a more equitable and just future for everyone. Throughout her career, she has consistently focused on the unintended consequences of design and how they can be fixed.</p>
    <p>Her early research focused on transportation and pollution, specifically how people's behavior on the road could change how much pollution was emitted by cars. When she showed that those pollutants traveled farther than California state guidelines accounted for, policy changes were made to better protect against the health hazard. While a professor at UC Davis, she founded the Sustainable Design Academy to allow students to work on projects focused on sustainable engineering.</p>
    <p>In 2019, Dr. Niemeier joined the faculty of University of Maryland, College Park as the Clark Distinguished Chair in Sustainability and a Professor in Civil and Environmental Engineering. Her work is grounded in the study of how existing infrastructure systems can harm marginalized communities, especially in light of climate change and disasters. She collaborates with professionals across many fields to understand structural inequality and to find solutions for ongoing structural inequality. In 2022, she became Director of the University's Center for Disaster Resilience. She is a member of NAE, a Guggenheim Fellow and was awarded the 2023 Bower Award for Science Achievement.</p>

    <p>Katrina Sky Munsterman is a Ph.D. student studying fish ecology at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. She examines the role of fish and fisher behavior in small-scale reef fisheries.</p>
    <p>In 2022, Munsterman undertook an APS-funded project: “Exploring Optimal Foraging in a Common Reef Fish in The Bahamas.” Over 16 weeks, she tracked the locations of 48 white grunts (a small reef fish) in an artificial reef system to better understand their movement behaviors. Beyond their role in reef ecosystems, grunts and other reef fish are food staples for many Caribbean communities. Munsterman is using fish movement data in combination with ecological models to better understand how artificial reefs can be used to manage fisheries and sustainably feed coastal communities.</p>

    <p>Work on building self confidence, as an antidote to efforts by others, either intentionally or unintentionally, to undermine your progress and success. Pursue science projects that fully engage your curiosity and attention, having as much fun as possible in the process. Be open to unexpected observations that may (serendipitously) lead you to more exciting findings and new areas of research. Don't be afraid to represent yourself! Know when to say no:-)</p>

    <p>William Church Osborn Professor of Sociology and Public Affairs, Director, Center for Research on Child Wellbeing, Princeton University.</p>
    <p>Kathryn Edin's research has taken on key mysteries about poverty that have not been fully answered by prior research. The hallmark of her research is her direct, in-depth observations of the lives of low-income women, men, and children.</p>
    <h3>Naomi Ellemers</h3>
    <p>Distinguished University Professor, Social and Behavioral Sciences, Utrecht University.</p>
    <p>Naomi Ellemer's scientific publications explain how group affiliations shape individuals, in work and life—especially self-categorizing as a group member, permeability of boundaries, within-group variability, group commitment, and group esteem.</p>
