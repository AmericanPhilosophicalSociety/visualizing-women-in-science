biography: Sheila Cohen was an American biochemist and biophysicist who pioneered new uses of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to study living tissue. Cohen received her PhD in physical chemistry from Florida State University in 1969 on calculations of NMR spectra. She was then an assistant professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago. In 1977, she was hired by Bell Laboratories, working as a post-doctoral researcher in nuclear magnetic resonance. During this time, she began corresponding with Mildred Cohn and Britton Chance. In 1980, Cohen became a senior research scientist at Merck, working in the departments of biophysics and drug metabolism. Her research has contributed to the understanding of the mechanisms behind pharmaceutical treatments for diabetes and prostate cancer.
