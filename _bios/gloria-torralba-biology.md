biography: Gloria Torralba was a molecular biologist. Born in the Philippines, Torralba came to the United States to continue her studies. She received her doctorate in molecular biology from the University of Pennsylvania. Mildred Cohn supervised her studies, and Torralba spoke fondly of the colleagues she met in Cohn's lab in her correspondence with Cohn. Towards the end of her studies, Torralba took up a series of research positions in southern California, remaining an active chemist for the rest of her career.
