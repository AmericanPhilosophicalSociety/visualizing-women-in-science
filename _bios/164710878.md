notes: 
biography: Agnes Pockels was a German citizen scientist who was one of the first people to research surface tension. Pockels lived at a time when German universities were closed to women and, out of necessity, she was an autodidact. Her brother studied physics at the University of Göttingen, giving her access to his textbooks. While performing domestic chores, such as washing the dishes, Pockels started to ask questions about the effects of soap on water. She conducted experiments out of her own home, developing an apparatus to take measurements of the soapy water's surface properties. These experiments allowed Pockels to provide a thorough explanation of surface tension and paved the way for the modern discipline of surface science. Pockels never had a paid position as a scientist and, despite publishing 14 papers, spent most of her life as a caretaker for her parents. While it is unlikely Florence Sabin personally knew Pockels, Sabin featured Pockels in her article, "Women in Science."
