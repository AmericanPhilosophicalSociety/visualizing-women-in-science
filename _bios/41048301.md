notes: 
biography: Sara Josephine Baker was an American public health leader. Baker was responsible for numerous public health initiatives in New York City, most notably taking measures to reduce the rate of infant mortality and tracking down "Typhoid Mary," a woman with asymptomatic typhoid fever who caused a massive outbreak. Baker received her medical degree in 1898 from New York Infirmary Medical College. After a short internship in Boston, she worked as a private physician in New York City and as a medical inspector for the Department of Health. Baker set up a program to educate mothers in infant hygiene, which greatly helped improve both the rate of infant mortality and the overall health of New York City's children. In her private life, Baker lived together with author Ida Ross Wylie and physician Louise Pearce. Baker tended to wear men's suits and joked that her colleagues forgot she was a woman.
