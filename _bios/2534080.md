notes: 
biography: Virginia Walbot is an American botanist who works on maize development. She has had an interest in plant life, including marize, since her youth, helping out on her family's farm in southern California. Educated at Stanford and Yale, Walbot first began studying maize academically after visiting Barbara McClintock's lab in Cold Spring Harbor. Walbot was a trailblazer for young women in science, organizing efforts to circulate job openings widely in her field in order to make it easier for women to find opportunities. In 1998, Walbot was awarded a $12.54 million grant from the National Science Foundation for the Maize Gene Discovery Project, a project that helped pave the way for the complete sequencing of the maize genome. Walbot has also conducted groundbreaking research in maize sex determination.
