notes: 
biography: Tilly Edinger was a German Jewish paleontologist and founder of the field of paleoneurology. Born into a well-off family, Edinger received and exceptional education and studied zoology and paleontology in Heidelberg and Munich. She completed her doctoral dissertation at the University of Frankfurt, and then became a curator of vertebrate paleontology at the Naturmuseum Senckenberg. During this time, she discovered that the sediment remaining in mammalian fossil skulls could be used to reconstruct the shape of the creature's brain. In the 1930s, Edinger continued her work at the Naturmuseum Senckenberg in secret to avoid persecution by the German state. She left Germany for London and then later the United States in 1938. In the United States, she worked at the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology, where she continued her research on mammalian evolution.
