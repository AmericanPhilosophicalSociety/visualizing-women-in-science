notes: 
biography: Rachel Carson is known for her vast works of literature, from writing pamphlets on biology and conservationism, to editing scientific articles, to publishing her own books on marine life. Carson's early work at the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries displayed her passion for conservationism and nature, specifically in the Baltimore Sun. However, her most popular works include <i>Under the Sea</i> (1941), <i>The Sea Around Us</i> (1952), <i>The Edge of the Sea</i> (1955), and <i>Silent Spring</i> (1962). In the 1950s, Carson conducted research into the effects of pesticides on the food chain, condemning the pesticide DDT. Although she had been criticized by the chemical industry for her outspoken opinions on DDT, even having a large campaign developed to discredit her research findings, she continuously expressed the danger pesticides have on marine life and wildlife. DDT was eventually banned after the influence of her research, helping shape the government's environmental consciousness and motivation to preserve wildlife. After suffering from breast cancer for quite some time, Carson died in Silver Spring, Maryland at age 58.
