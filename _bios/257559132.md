notes: 
biography: Thelma B. Dunn's research focused on human cancer research. Her work with mice led to many breakthroughs in cancer research. In 1942, Dunn became a fellow at the National Cancer Research Institute where she worked as a staff pathologist until her retirement in 1970. She was also the head of the Cancer Induction and Pathogenesis Section of the pathology department. Dunn's work focused heavily on the origins and development of cancer in laboratory mice. She developed methods of inducing malignant tumors in the stomachs and intestines of experimental animals and studied the behavior of the cancer cells that resulted. Dunn corresponded with Florence Seibert about the latter's investigations into cancer, providing critical feedback on Seibert's work.
