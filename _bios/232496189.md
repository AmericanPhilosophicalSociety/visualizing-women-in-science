notes: 
biography: Mary Letitia Caldwell was an American chemist. Caldwell received her PhD from Columbia in pure science in 1921 with a dissertation on amino acids. She subsequently became an instructor and, in 1929, was appointed assistant professor of chemistry, the first woman to receive such a position at Columbia's Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. In 1951, she left teaching to devote herself full-time to her research on enzymes. In 1960, the American Chemical Society awarded her the Garvan Medal for her work on amylase. In studying amylase, Caldwell produced many new, widely adopted techniques for purifying and handling enzymes.
