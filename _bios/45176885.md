notes: 
biography: Helen Taussig was an American cardiologist known for founding the field of pediatric cardiology. Taussig started her undergraduate studies at Radcliffe College, but transferred to University of California Berkeley. Upon graduation, she intended to study medicine at Harvard. Her father tried to convince her to study public health, which he thought was more suitable for women, but she persisted. At the time, Harvard admitted women medical students but would not grant them a degree. Taussig took prerequisite courses in the Boston area before deciding to attend Johns Hopkins Medical School instead. Here she studied with Florence Sabin. After graduation, she was offered a position at a pediatric clinic at Johns Hopkins, where she would remain for the rest of her career. Her research led to the concept for a procedure that would extend the lives of children born with what was commonly called "blue baby syndrome" and is medically known as Tetralogy of Fallot. Taussig's research led to a procedure known as the Blalock-Thomas-Taussig shunt, a surgical procedure that alleviates the situation. Taussig is also known for her work in banning thalidomide, a drug that pregnant women took to prevent morning sickness, but had the unknown side effect of limiting the growth of a fetus's limbs. She was the first woman to be elected as head of the American heart association.
