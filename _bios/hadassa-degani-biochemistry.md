biography: Hadassa Degani is an Israeli biochemist and chemist. Degani's research focuses on using magnetic resonance imaging to detect and study cancer. Degani received her PhD from the State University of New York at Stony Brook in chemistry in 1974. She began working at the Weizmann Institute of Science in 1976 and remained there for the duration of her career. Her early work focused on studying the formation of cancer in blood vessels. Among her most significant scientific contributions is the development of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), a noninvasive technique which allows for the early detection of several forms of cancer. Degani collaborated closely with Mildred Cohn and several other scientists in her network.
