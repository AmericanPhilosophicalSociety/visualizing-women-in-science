notes: 
biography: Ethel Ronzoni was an American biochemist. Ronzoni attended college at Mills College without familial support and subsequently received a master's degree from Columbia University in 1914. She taught home economics at the University of Missouri and the University of Minnesota for a number of years before earning her PhD in physiology from the University of Wisconsin. In 1923, Ronzoni was appointed assistant professor in the Department of Medicine at Washington University in St. Louis. Ronzoni was the first woman to join the faculty of Washington University's School of Medicine. Ronzoni's research concerned carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and muscle biochemistry. Mildred Cohn noted that Ronzoni was an outstanding American chemist in a letter about notable American women.
