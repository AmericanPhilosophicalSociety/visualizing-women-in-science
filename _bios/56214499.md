notes: 
biography: Louise Pearce was an American pathologist most known for developing a treatment for African sleeping sickness. For her efforts, she was awarded the Order of the Crown of Belgium around 1920 and was appointed an Officer of the Order of the Lion by the Belgian government in 1953. Pearce received a degree in physiology from Stanford University in 1907 and her medical degree from Johns Hopkins University in 1912. In 1913, she took a position at the Rockefeller Institute in the lab of Simon Flexner. She would remain at the Rockefeller Institute for the rest of her career. Pearce lived together with physician S. Josephine Baker and author Ida R. Wylie. All three were members of Heterodoxy, a biweekly lunch club that advocated for feminist positions.
