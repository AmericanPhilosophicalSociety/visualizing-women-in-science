biography: Gulli Lindh Muller was a Swedish American medical research. Born in Sweden, she moved to the United States and completed her undergraduate education at Barnard College in 1917. Lindh was instrumental in opening the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University to women students. Upon her graduation, dean Virginia Gildersleeve enlisted Lindh to start a campaign to allow the admittance of women. The dean of the medical college demanded $50,000 in donations to fund improvements to the building to accommodate the women. After the funds were raised, Lindh was admitted as part of the first cohort of ten women students and received her MD in 1921. Muller, who married in 1919, worked at Boston City Hospital and the Rutland State Sanitorium in Massachusetts. In 1940, she became Chief of the New England Hospital for Women and Children. She was a productive researcher and coauthored a successful medical sciences textbook.
