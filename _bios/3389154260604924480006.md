notes: 
biography: Florence Peebles was an American embryologist. Her work concerned tissue regeneration in animals. She received her undergraduate degree in physiology from the Women's Medical College of Baltimore (later Goucher College) and her PhD from Bryn Mawr in 1900. Peebles taught biology at Bryn Mawr, Goucher, Tulane University, and Chapman University. She established the bacteriology department at Chapman University and founded the biology laboratory at Lewis and Clark College. When Florence Sabin chose not to advance Matilda Moldenhauer Brooks's application to the Naples Table Association, Peebles sent in an impassioned defense of Brooks, which contributed to Brooks eventually being awarded the table.
