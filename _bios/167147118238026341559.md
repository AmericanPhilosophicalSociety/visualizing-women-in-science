notes: 
biography: Kathryn McHale worked in the fields of education and psychology. She earned her PhD in psychology from Columbia University. She was also the director of the American Association of University Women (AAUW). McHale emphasized women's health issues and encouraged AAUW members to learn about early detection of cancer. Her approach to the AAUW was conservative and she steered the organization away from addressing the legalization of birth control, which she personally was against, and declined to take a stand on racial integration at AAUW. McHale also participated in the 1950s Red Scare reactionary Subversive Activities Control Board. McHale corresponded with Florence Sabin and others about finding placements for foreign scholars.
