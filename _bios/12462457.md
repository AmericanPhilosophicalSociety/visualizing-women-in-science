notes: 
biography: Józefa Joteyko was a Polish physiologist, psychologist, and educational reformer. Born in Kiev, her family moved to Warsaw when she was still a child. Joteyko was educated in Switzerland, France, and Belgium, earning her medical degree at the University of Paris in 1896. Her thesis concerned the physiology of muscle fatigue. Joteyko spent much of her career in Belgium, conducting research at the Solvay Physiological Institute and lecturing at the Free University of Brussels. While Joteyko's early research concerned the workings of the nervous system, she increasingly became interested in childhood development. This led to an increasing interest in social organization and pedagogy. When Poland became independent in1918, Joteyko returned but was unable to secure a research position due to discrimination against women. She therefore turned her attention to social reform and social pedagogy. Joteyko was nominated for the Ellen Richards Research Prize in 1928.
