biography: Aviva Lapidot was an Israeli chemist. Lapidot studied at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem and was one of only four women in her class who chose to study chemistry. In the mid-1950s, Lapidot received her first job in chemical research, assuming a research assistantship in the Isotope Department of the Weizmann Institute for Science in Rehovot, Israel. She was encouraged by her supervisor to write a PhD thesis, but the Weizmann Institute was not able to grant them at the time. In 1961, she received her PhD from the Hebrew University, although the work was done at the Weizmann Institute. In 1968, Lapidot received a position at the Weizmann Institute as a PI and began conducting her own research using non-radioactive isotopes and nuclear magnetic resonance. Lapidot remained at the Weizmann Institute until her death in 2018, publishing on cancer and HIV/AIDS.
