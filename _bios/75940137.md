notes: 
biography: Mary Mrose was an American mineralogist and geologist. Mrose started her career as a junior high school teacher, having earned an MA in geography from Boston University. However, Mrose started studying geology and, by the 1940s, she was teaching geology at Boston University while working as a research assistant in the Department of Mineralogy at Harvard. While at Harvard, Mrose learned how to use an x-ray diffractometer to obtain measurements of minerals. She left Harvard to take a research assistant position with the US Geological Service in 1953, working there for 30 years. After her retirement from the US Geological Service in 1983, Mrose worked for the National Institute of Standards and Technology, preparing data for a mineralogical database. The mineral "Mroseite" is named in her honor.
