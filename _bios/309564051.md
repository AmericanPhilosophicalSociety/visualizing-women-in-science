biography: Esther Caukin Brunauer worked for the American Association of University Women. In 1933, Brunauer was working in Germany as the German government transferred power to the Nazi party. Following this, Brunauer was a strong advocate for American intervention in Europe, arguing for a less isolationist foreign policy. In this network, her efforts manifest in the tireless attempts she made at securing jobs for scholars displaced by fascism. She wrote numerous letters on behalf of scholars such as Lise Meitner and Hertha Sponer in an attempt to find them safe passage out of Germany. Later, Brunauer worked for the US State Department but lost her job as a part of Joseph McCarthy's investigations into people he perceived as disloyal to the United States.
