notes: 
biography: Margaret Herrman Kurbatov was an American chemist. She received her PhD from the University of Chicago in chemistry in 1931 with a dissertation on isomerism. In 1945, she began working at Ohio State University and was instrumental in establishing radiochemistry as a special concentration of the department. She retired in 1961 and both she and her husband Joann Ivan D. Kurbatov moved to Victoria, BC. Kurbatov and her husband, a professor of physics, collaborated on numerous projects, including a study of complex beta decay spectra commissioned by the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. Both were close friends of Rose Mooney-Slater.

description: It seems RMS was possibly Ivan's professor? Or at least he called her professor. Margaret (Peg) and RMS are very friendly and share lists of chemicals in each other's labs. Margaret worked for the Ohio State University as a research technician, but also taught, one letter listing very large lectures.
