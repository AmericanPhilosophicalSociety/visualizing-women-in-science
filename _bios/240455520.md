notes: 
biography: Margaret Reed Lewis was a cytologist and embryologist. She is considered the first person to grow mammalian tissue <i>in vitro</i> during an experiment conducted in collaboration with Rhoda Erdmann in 1908. Together with her husband Warren Lewis, she developed a clear medium for cell growth known as the Locke-Lewis solution. She also made important contributions to cancer research through her research in embryology and cell biology. In 1951, she isolated a tumor in a mouse lung, which became the first transplantable tumor. This furthered the development of tumor models. Lewis worked collaboratively with her husband for nearly all of her career.
