notes: 
biography: Irène Joliot-Curie was a French chemist and physicist. Along with her husband Frédéric Joliot-Curie, she was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1935 for discovering that radioactive elements could be created from stable ones. Joliot-Curie was the daughter of Nobel Prize winners Pierre and Marie Curie and pursued science her whole life. She received her doctorate from the University of Paris in 1925, writing her thesis on the radioactive properties of polonium, an element discovered by her parents. Her key discovery of the synthesis of radioactive elements had wide-ranging consequences, particularly for medicine. It enabled the production of the radioactive materials necessary for certain medical treatments at low cost. Later in life, Joliot-Curie was instrumental in the establishment of nuclear energy in France. Joliot-Curie developed leukemia as a consequence of her lifetime of research on radiation and died in 1956.
