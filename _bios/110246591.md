notes: 
biography: Cecilia Helena Payne-Gaposchkin's groundbreaking research in astronomy included the discovery that stars are made primarily of hydrogen and helium. Though she made this discovery while writing her dissertation, Henry Norris Russell discouraged her from including this as it contradicted the current scientific consensus. Russell later came to the same conclusion she did and published a paper in 1929. Though he credited Payne-Gaposchkin for discovering the composition of stars, the discovery is still often credited to him. She was the first woman to be a full professor at Harvard. Payne-Gaposchkin was one of the 250 scientists listed in the 1927 edition of <i>American Men of Science</i>. She was awarded the Annie J. Cannon award, the Rittenhouse Medal and has both an asteroid and volcano named after her.
