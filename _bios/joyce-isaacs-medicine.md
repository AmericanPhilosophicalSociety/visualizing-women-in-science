notes: I think Isaacs married and changed her name to E. Joyce Saward, but I'm having difficulty confirming this.
biography: E. Joyce Isaacs was a Jamaican doctor who ran a tuberculosis clinic in Kingston. In collaboration with Eugene Opie of the Henry Phipps Institute at the University of Pennsylvania and the Rockefeller Foundation’s International Health Division, Isaacs treated local tuberculosis patients and collected research data for Opie's lab in the late 1920s and early 1930s. She worked closely with Opie and Phipps Institute statistician Persis Putnam on comparative studies on tuberculosis, comparing the spread of the disease in Jamaica with its spread in Philadelphia. In her correspondence with Opie, Isaacs repeatedly attributes the spread of tuberculosis in Jamaica to social reasons such as poverty or inadequate housing; however, in more recent years, these studies have been critiqued for conflating these social conditions with the patients' race.
