biography: Elizabeth Hirschfelder was an American mathematician. She received her bachelor's degree from the Women's College of Brown in 1923 and her master's the following year. Afterwards, she taught mathematics at the University of Texas in Austin and Texas Tech University in Lubbock. In 1930, she received her PhD from the University of Wisconsin-Madison with a dissertation in abstract algebra. She continued working as a lecturer at the University of Wisconsin until her marriage to Joseph Hirschfelder in 1953. The following year, she left her position to support her husband's busy travel schedule. Hirschfelder and her husband were good friends of Rose Mooney-Slater and John Clark Slater, spending many winters with them on Sanibel, Florida.
