notes: 
biography: Clara Lynch was a biologist specializing in cancer research. She was one of the first women active in this field. Educated at Smith College and Columbia University, she joined the faculty of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research in 1918. In her research, she found evidence for the heritability of susceptibility to cancer. She found that mice were more likely to develop tumors if their parents had also developed tumors. Lynch was also responsible for introducing the Swiss albino mouse to the United States. This mouse became enormously popular in scientific research, and Lynch provided many of her colleagues with mice for their experiments.
