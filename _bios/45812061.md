biography: Anita Klein is an American biologist and geneticist. Klein received her PhD from Michigan State University in 1981 with a dissertation on the enzymes involved in cell wall regeneration in soybean cells. Following that, she held a post-doc at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in the laboratory of Oliver Nelson. During this time, she began working on maize genetics and began her correspondence with Barbara McClintock. In 1985, Klein joined the department of biochemistry at the University of New Hampshire, where she is currently an associate professor emerita of biological sciences.
