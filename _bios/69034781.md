biography: Margaret Washburn was an American psychologist. She was the first woman to be granted a doctorate in psychology in the United States and the second woman to serve as president of the American Psychological Association. She received her PhD from Cornell University in 1894. Washburn is best known for her textbook <i>The Animal MInd</i>, which reviewed leading research on animal psychology and behavior. Washburn was nominated for the Ellen Richards Research Prize; however, her nomination did not move forward due to concerns about the status of psychology as an experimental science.
