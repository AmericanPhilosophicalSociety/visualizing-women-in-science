notes: 
biography: Loverine ("Lovie") Taylor is an American plant geneticist. She received her PhD in 1985 working in the laboratory of Virginia Walbot. After receiving her PhD, she served as a professor in the School of Molecular Biosciences at Washington State University. Taylor's published research has concerned transposable elements in plant genetics, with particular focus on pollen germination. In the Barbara McClintock papers, there is evidence of Taylor's collaborations with her advisor Virginia Walbot, Anita Klein, Vicki Chandler, and Barbara McClintock.
