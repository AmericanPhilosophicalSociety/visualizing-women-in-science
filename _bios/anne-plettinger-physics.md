notes: probably Zachariasen's assistant, thanked in papers as "Miss Anne Plettinger," so doesn't seem shehad an advanced degree
biography: Henrietta Anne Plettinger worked in the lab of William Zachariasen at the University of Chicago. Plettinger graduated from Newcomb College in 1939. In 1943, she received a position as a research assistant at the Metallurgical Laboratory working as part of the Manhattan Project. Here, she worked with Zachariasen and Rose Mooney-Slater, producing the majority of the diffraction images used in studying the structure of plutonium. She remained at Chicago for 30 years, coauthoring numerous papers with Zachariasen. Plettinger was also an active photographer. Upon retirement, she returned to her native Louisiana and was active as an environmental activist, advocating for the public in matters of nuclear energy.
