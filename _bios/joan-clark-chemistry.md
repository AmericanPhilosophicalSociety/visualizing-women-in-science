notes: 
biography: Joan R. Clark was an American crystallographer. Clark studied mathematics at Barnard College and was hired by the Manhattan Project as a math assistant. It was here that she first became interested in crystallography. In 1958, she received her PhD in geochemistry from Johns Hopkins University. Afterwards, she worked for the United States Geological Survey. Her scientific accomplishments include using mathematical modeling to study the structure of protein and examining moon rocks brought to Earth by Apollo 11. In 1962, she spent a year visiting the University of Sydney as a Fulbright scholar. In 1999, she endowed the Joan R. Clark Research Scholarship, awarded by the University of Sydney for Australians pursuing research abroad.
