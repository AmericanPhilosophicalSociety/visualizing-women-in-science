notes: 
biography: Pauline Ramart-Lucas was a French chemist and was the second woman appointed as a full professor at the University of Paris after Marie Curie. Ramart worked for several years as a research assistant at the Institut Pasteur. In 1924, she earned her doctorate in organic chemistry. With the exception of three years during World War II where she focused on radiology, the bulk of her life's work was spent at the Sorbonne researching organic chemistry, specifically the molecular compounds that occur during alcohol dehydration. She received several awards and recognitions for her scientific contributions including France's Legion of Honor and the Ellen Richards Research Prize from the American Association of University Women. She published more than 100 articles, memoirs and scientific contributions.
