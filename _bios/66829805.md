notes: 
biography: Helen Thompson Woolley was an American psychologist. Her research was among the first to empirically test culturally-based assumptions about the gender differences between the sexes. Her dissertation <i>The Psychological Norms in Men and Women</i> attracted interest as well as scrutiny from the scientific world and examined the similarities and differences in the mental traits of men and women. Throughout her career Woolley worked at Mount Holyoke College, University of Chicago, University of Cincinnati, and Teacher's College.
