notes: 
biography: Lizann Bolinger is a researcher specializing in magnetic resonance imaging. Bolinger completed her PhD in biophysics at the University of Pennsylvania in 1989 with a dissertation on new techniques for nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging. Subsequently, she held professorships at the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Iowa. In 2003, she left academia and worked at the Institute for Biodiagnostics at the National Research Council of Canada. She continues to work in industry today.
