notes: 
biography: Eleanor Alexander-Jackson was a microbiologist who began studying tuberculosis forms. She worked at Cornell University in the 1950s studying TB and leprosy, and worked on the idea that cancer came from a germ. She frequently appears in the letters between Irene Diller and Florence Seibert. Their method of studying tumors differed in the media they used in which to study the tumor. However, by 1968 Alexander-Jackson and Diller were reviewing and writing articles together and seem to form a research circle including Virginia Livingston and Janet Howell Clark, all examining the role germs (or "bugs" as they call them in their letters) play in tumor growth.
