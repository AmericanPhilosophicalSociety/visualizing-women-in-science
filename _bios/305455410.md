notes: 
biography: Persis Putnam was a biostatistician working in public health. After completing her PhD at Johns Hopkins University under the supervision of Lowell J. Reed in 1926, she assumed a position in the Rockefeller Foundation's International Health Division. Putnam was thanked and credited in numerous papers for her excellent statistical analysis, including in Eugene Opie's work with E. Joyce Isaacs on tuberculosis in Jamaica. She also authored numerous papers on tuberculosis, malaria, and other matters of public health. Some of the work done by Putnam, Opie, and Isaacs has been criticized for its focus on race in the spread of tuberculosis.
