notes: 
biography: Sarah Ratner was an American biochemist. In 1920, she went to Cornell University to study chemistry on scholarship. Upon graduation, she worked for several years in a laboratory at Long Island College Hospital. In the early 1930s, Ratner continued her academic career, applying for doctoral studies in the lab of Hans Thacher Clarke at Columbia University. At the time, the only entrance requirement was surviving an intense one-on-one interview with Clarke, which Ratner passed successfully. During her time at Columbia, Ratner focused on problems in organic chemistry, studying the reactions of complex molecules. She also observed that a compound in human semen could cause uterine contractions, a finding that was published by her colleagues Raphael Kurzrok and Charles Lieb in a paper that acknowledged her assistance but did not provide coauthorship. Ratner had difficulty finding a position after graduation due to her gender, but eventually received a position in Rudolf Schoenheimer's lab at Columbia. In 1946, she became an assistant professor of pharmacology at New York University. In the mid-1950s, she left the university system to become a staff member at the Department of Biochemistry at the Public Health Research Institute of New York. Ratner's most significant scientific contributions concern metabolism, particularly amino acid metabolism and nitrogen metabolism. Her contributions have led to a more complete picture of disorders in urea synthesis.
