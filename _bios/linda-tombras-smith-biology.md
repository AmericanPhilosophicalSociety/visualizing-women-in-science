biography: Linda Tombras Smith is an American chemist. She received PhD in chemistry from the University of California San Diego in 1977. She then served as a post-doctoral research assistant in Mildred Cohn's lab at the University of Pennsylvania. After that, Smith returned to California, taking a professorship at the University of California Davis. Later in her career, she switched her focus to environmental policy, serving as chief of the Health and Exposure Assessment Branch for the Research Division of the California Environmental Protection Agency. Smith's research has considered enzymology, the pathogen <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i>, and the effect of air pollution on health.
