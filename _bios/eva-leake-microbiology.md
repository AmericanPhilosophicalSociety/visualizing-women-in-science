biography: Eva Soto Figueroa earned a degree in Chemistry, specializing in Bacteriology from the Escuela Nacional de Ciencias Biologicas, a part of the Institute Politecnico Nacional in Mexico. Under the advisement of Eugenia Cardona Lynch, Eva reached out to Florence Seibert hoping to study with her in 1951. Eva worked alongside Lynch at the Sanitario Hospital "Dr. Manuel Gea Gonzalez" in the Department of Pathology. After Lynch unexpectedly died in 1951, Seibert continued to do all she could to help Eva come to the US and complete her studies, including reaching out to funding agencies who might offer a fellowship for Eva, who while guaranteed money from the State Department for a fellowship, had to wait for nearly four months to finally be paid due to beuroacratic backlog. In 1952, Eva undertook graduate study at the University of Pennsylvania under Seibert's direction and worked as a research technician. Seibert recommends Eva to many opportunities, including indexing journals and membership in Sixma Xi. Eva married Keith Leake and took a position at Wake Forest College in North Carolina.
