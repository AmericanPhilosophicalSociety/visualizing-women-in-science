notes: 
biography: Gertrude Stein was an acclaimed modernist author. Before her career in the arts, she attended Johns Hopkins Medical School from 1897 to 1902, studying with Florence Sabin under Franklin Mall. While Stein was a competent student for her first years of medical school, she lost interest and did not successfully graduate with the rest of the class. She was given the chance to receive her degree if she could produce a model and description of the brain. Though she produced the required model, Mall and Sabin, who had since taken a position at Hopkins, found major errors in it. The paper was allegedly thrown in the trash. Sabin recounts her opinion of Stein in a letter to another graduate of Johns Hopkins, Joseph M. Flint. There, she ridicules Stein as a sloppy researcher and accuses her of making a mess of the laboratory. Stein's experience at Johns Hopkins is reflected in several of her works, including <i>Q.E.D.</i> and <i>The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</i>.
