biography: Janet Mertz is an American biochemist and oncologist. Mertz was instrumental in the discovery of methods for joining DNA from different species and creating recombinant DNA cloned in bacteria. Mertz studied biochemistry at Stanford under Paul Berg. Berg encouraged Mertz to study the replication and expression recombinant DNA in <i>E. coli</i>, and she developed a research plan that would involve inserting three strands of DNA into an <i>E. coli</i> sample. However, while working at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in 1971, concerns were raised about the potential ramifications of such a procedure. As <i>E. coli</i> was a common human pathogen, the safety concerns if such a sample were introduced into the general population were enormous. This led to an informal moratorium on all cloning experiments, leading Mertz to focus on developing techniques for constructing recombinant DNA. Later, other scientists, including Berg, used her methods in combination with cloning <i>E. coli</i>, which led to enormous advances in biotechnology. Berg was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in part due to Mertz's discoveries. After receiving her PhD, Mertz became a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and has made many important discoveries in gene expression in viruses and cancer research. Mertz has also played an active role in debunking myths about the role of gender in mathematical aptitude.
