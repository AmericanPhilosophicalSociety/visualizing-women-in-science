notes: 
biography: Gina Castelnuovo was an Italian zoologist, microbiologist, and pathologist. Daughter of the famous mathematician Guido Castelnuovo, she had a successful career in Rome working on a wide variety of topics, including the embryology and biometry of insects, the influence of sexual hormones on fish development, and the hormonal development of rats. She was forced to flee Italy in 1938 on account of being Jewish. She reached the United States after a brief stay at Copenhagen and continued her career in Philadelphia and Columbia, Missouri. After the war, Castelnuovo returned to Rome where she continued to be an influential biologist.

description: "Louise Pearce shares a note with FRS that Castelnuovo is an Italian refugee looking for a position as she can't return to Italy because she is Jewish. Professor Veblen was working to help her, she was living with Professor and Mrs. Fermi. According to another source, she also had help from Niels Bohr (Jewish Responses to Persecution: 1938–1940, By Alexandra Garbarini, 55-56)"
