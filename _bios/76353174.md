notes: 
biography: Marie Curie's research on radioactivity made her the "first" woman in science in many distinguished ways. She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize (in Physics, 1903), the first person and only woman to win two Nobel Prizes when she received her Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1911, and the first woman professor at the University of Paris. In 1895 she married French physicist Pierre Curie and together they researched radioactivity, which led to sharing the 1903 Nobel Prize along with Henri Becquerel. The Curies are credited with discovering both polonium and radium and coining the word radioactivity. After Pierre Curie's tragic accident and death by a fast-moving carriage, Marie Curie focused on growing the Radium Institute to study the new phenomenon of radioactivity. During World War I she worked to develop medical technologies relying on radium that could save the lives of soldiers on the front, specifically mobile X-ray units. She died in 1934 likely due to long-term exposure to radiation, which damaged her bone marrow.
