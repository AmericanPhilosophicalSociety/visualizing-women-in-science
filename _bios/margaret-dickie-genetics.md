biography: Margaret Dickie was an American mouse geneticist. Dickie spent most of her career at the Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor, Maine, where she began working in 1942 while she was still completing her undergraduate work at Mount Holyoke College. She researched naturally occurring mutant strains in mice and successfully identified several that could serve as animal models for human diseases. Most significantly, she discovered a mouse model for obesity in collaboration with Priscilla Lane in 1950. Dickie died at age 47 after a sudden illness.
