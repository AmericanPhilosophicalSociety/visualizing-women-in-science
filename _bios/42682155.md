notes: 
biography: Vera Mikhailovna Danchakoff was a Russian anatomist. Educated in Lausanne, Kharkiv, and Moscow, Danchakoff became the first woman in Russia both to receive a medical degree and be appointed a professor. In 1915, she moved to the United States and took a position at Columbia University. Danchakoff made many important discoveries in embryology and was one of the first to provide a theoretical explanation of stem cells. During the 1920s, Danchakoff was a tireless advocate for scientists in the Soviet Union and organized relief efforts to publicize the struggles of and provide support to scientists during the Russian famine of 1921-22. After her unit was dissolved in 1934, Danchakoff returned to the Soviet Union, taking a position in Lithuania; however, she remained a US citizen. During the 1930s, she demonstrated the key role played by hormones in mammalian sex differentiation. Evidence in the Warren H. Lewis papers suggest she was forced from her position and returned to the US in the late 1930s, but it is unclear what happened to her after that. Nonetheless, she continued her research up until her death in 1950.
