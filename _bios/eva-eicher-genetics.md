notes: 
biography: Eva Eicher was a mouse geneticist. She studied at the University of Rochester with Ernst W. Caspari, who named Eicher among the best students he had ever overseen. Shortly after graduation, she took a position at the Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor, ME, where she remained for the rest of her career. Eicher's research focused on sex determination in mice.
