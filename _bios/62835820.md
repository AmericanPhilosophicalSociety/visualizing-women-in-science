biography: "Bertha Van Hoosen was an American surgeon and advocate for women in science. The founder and first president of the American Medical Women's Association, Van Hoosen furthered the position of women in science not only through her own career as a working physician and educator, but also through fundraising efforts for women scientists. Van Hoosen and Florence Sabin corresponded about funding for events and efforts to elevate the prominence of women scientists. She was an advocate for basic medical hygeine, including sterilization of instruments. She was a practitioner, teacher and researcher and practiced at many institutions throughou Michigan and Illinois: namely, Kalamazoo, Michigan State Hospital for the Insane, Women's Hospital in Detroit, and Cook County Hospital in Chicago. She detailed her experiences in medicine in her autobiography <i>Petticoat Surgeon</i>. Some of the many experiences she recounts include examples of harrassment by fellow male students and other male medical professionals. In 1928, she was nominated for the Ellen Richards Research Prize. The Bertha Van Hoosen Award is given to a woman who has served the American Medical Women's Association."
