biography: Salome Gluecksohn-Waelsch researched in the area of developmental genetics. She studied both chemistry and zoology in Königsberg and Berlin, taking a position at the University of Freiburg in 1928. She later went on to become a lecturer at Columbia University in 1936, working in Leslie C. Dunn's genetics lab for 17 years. Gluecksohn-Waelsch research concerned the identification of genetic mutations that affected development, including how such mutations affected processes of development. Her work attempted to find "T-locus" mutations associated with early development. In 1963 she accepted a position as full professor and chair of molecular genetics at Albert Einstein College of Medicine. She often collaborated with Carl and Gerty Cori and also with Eva Eicher, with whom Salome Gluecksohn-Waelsch worked to write a grant. In she 1979 became a member of the National Academy of Sciences.
