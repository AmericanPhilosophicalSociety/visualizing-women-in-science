notes: 
biography: Microbiologist Gladys Hobby played a key role in furthering research on antibiotics, particularly penicillin. She began working with penicillin when it was still in its experimental phase and developed it for human use. She worked directly with the mass production of penicillin when she took a job with Pfizer Pharmaceuticals. At Pfizer she worked on drugs related to the treatment of tuberculosis. During this time, she corresponded with Florence Seibert, sharing research materials with her. In 1959, Hobby left Pfizer to specialize in chronic infectious diseases as chief of research at the Veterans Administration Hospital. She later founded a monthly publication entitled <i>Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy</i>, which she edited for years.
