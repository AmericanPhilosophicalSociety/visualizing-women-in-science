notes: 
biography: Matilda Moldenhauer Brooks was an American cellular biologist who discovered that the staining compound methylene blue could serve as an antidote to carbon monoxide and cyanide poisoning. She earned her BS and MS from the University of Pittsburgh and her Ph.D. from Harvard University. In 1930, Brooks applied to use the table held by the American Association of University Women at the Naples Zoological Station. Initially, Florence Sabin chose not to advance her application due to a perceived disagreeabilty in Brooks's personality, but was eventually granted the table anyway after a large number of scientists wrote in support of her application.

description: Dr. Matilda Moldenhauer Brooks - at Univesrity of California in 1930. Applies many times to the Naples Table Association prize, in 1930 there is a large debate over her work with Osterhut saying it's not good and others, like Lenoard Loeb, writing letters to support her. She is married and works with her husband. She is said to have a disagreeable personality that led to a dispute with a "Dr. Irwin." Brooks is awarded the Naples table for three months in 1931.
