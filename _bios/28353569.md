notes: 
biography: Mildred Cohn was Benjamin Rush Professor Emerita of Biochemistry and Biophysics at the University of Pennsylvania Medical School at the time of her death at age 96. She received her B.A. from Hunter College and her Ph.D. from Columbia University. During her career she served on the faculties of Cornell University Medical College, Washington University School of Medicine, and the University of Pennsylvania Medical School. She is known for her work using isotopes to understand the mechanisms of enzymatic reactions and for pioneering studies in NMR spectroscopy. In a lifetime of biochemical research, Dr. Cohn had seriously advanced the myriad of fields which had attracted her attention. She received the Cresson Medal of the Franklin Institute, the Women in Science Award of the New York Academy of Sciences, the Distinguished Service Award of the College of Physicians, the Garvan Medal of the American Chemical Society, the Stein and Moore Award for lifetime achievement from the Protein Society, the Humboldt Award, and, in 1982, the National Medal of Science. Dr. Cohn was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1972 and served with impeccable style and distinction as the Society's Vice President from 1994 to 2000.
