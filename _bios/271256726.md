biography: Fran Adar is an American physicist and biophysicist. Adar received her PhD in physics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1972. Her primary focus was on resonance Raman spectroscopy. She was then a postdoctoral fellow in biophysics at Penn, where she worked with Mildred Cohn and Britton Chance on applications of this new form of spectroscopy to biology. After her postdoc, Adar was an assistant professor at Penn for five years. In 1978, she took a position at Jobin Yvon (today HORIBA Scientific), working as an application scientist. She has remained there since, working on the development of instruments and applications of spectroscopy. Adar is a leading expert in the field of resonance Raman spectroscopy and has authored over 220 publications.
