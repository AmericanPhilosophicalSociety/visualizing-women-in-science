notes: 
biography: Anna Foà was an Italian entomologist. She was one of the first women to become a professor in Italy. Foà studied entomology in Rome. In 1905, she moved to Fauglia to conduct research on grape pylloxera, a pest that infects grapevines. After publication of her research on the pest, she received permission to teach at Italian universities. She received a professorship in Portici in 1920. In 1924, she became a professor at the University of Naples, conducting research on silkworms and bees. She worked there until 1938, when she lost her position on account of being Jewish. Little of her life is known beyond that point.
