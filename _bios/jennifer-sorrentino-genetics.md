notes: I am almost certain this person now goes by the name Jennifer Brown, but it is hard to prove conclusively. There is a Jennifer Brown who worked at duPont and worked with McClintock. In the folder, the name "Jennifer Brown-Sorrentino" is written on the top of one of the pages.
biography: Jennifer Brown is an American geneticist and public health advocate. In the papers of Barbara McClintock, she appears under the name "Jennifer Sorrentino." She worked at the Experimental Station for the E.I.du Pont de Nemours company, publishing research with Nancy Shepherd on maize genetics and transposable elements. She later moved to Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, where she worked with Barbara McClintock. In 1993, she received her PhD in Genetics from Stony Brook University. In her later career, she switched fields to science education and public health advocacy.
