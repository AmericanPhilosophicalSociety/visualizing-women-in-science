biography: Nina Simmonds Estill was an American nutritionist. Educated at Johns Hopkins University, she worked in the lab of Elmer Verner McCollum at the Wisconsin College of Agriculture in the 1920s, coauthoring numerous papers with him on diet and the nutritional properties of food. Simmonds corresponded frequently with Florence Sabin, and the latter often mentioned her as a rising young woman scientist. In 1928, Simmonds married. In a letter to Sabin, she admits she gave up her laboratory work to become a homemaker, feeling she could not "have two full time interests." However, her husband died in 1933 and Simmonds returned to the lab, working at the University of California Medical School and the University of California College of Dentistry in San Francisco.
