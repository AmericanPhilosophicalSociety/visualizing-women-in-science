notes: 
biography: Harriet Creighton was an American botanist and geneticist. A student of Barbara McClintock, Creighton worked with her mentor to demonstrate the phenomenon of chromosomal crossover, the process by which genetic material is exchanged between chromosomes during sexual reproduction. Creighton received her PhD from Cornell University in 1933, focusing on chromosomal crossover in her dissertation. She taught at Cornell and Connecticut College briefly, then, in 1940, became an associate professor of botany at Wellesley College where she remained until her retirement in 1974. Despite her early successes in research, Creighton devoted the majority of her career to teaching, publishing only sporadically after completing her doctorate.
