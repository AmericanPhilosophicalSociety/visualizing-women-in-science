notes: 
biography: Nancy Kleckner is an American molecular biologist and geneticist. Currently, she is the Herchel Smith Professor of Molecular Biology at Harvard University and runs Harvard's Kleckner Laboratory. Kleckner received her PhD from MIT in 1974 with a dissertation on the role of bacteriophage lambda in plasmid formation. After a postdoc at Princeton, Kleckner joined Harvard's faculty. Her research concerns transposons and mutagenesis, in particular the mechanical processes that influence chromosomes. She has made important discoveries in the process of chromosome replication.
