notes: Norlén signs her name with the accent in her notebooks. Judging by the name, she is probably Swedish.
biography: Karin Norlén was a research technician in Mildred Cohn's lab from 1973 to 1974. In a letter of recommendation, Cohn notes that Norlén performed her duties "most satisfactorily" and worked on enzyme preparations and preparation for NMR spectroscopy.
