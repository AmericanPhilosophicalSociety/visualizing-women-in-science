notes: 
biography: Barbara McClintock was a plant geneticist and recipient of the 1983 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for her discovery of mobile genetic elements. McClintock's research focused on maize, and she traced genetic transfer through the changes in the colored kernels of maize. In the 1930s she and Harriet Creighton discovered "crossing over," in which chromosomes break and recombine to create genetic changes. In the 1950s, she discovered the occurrence of transposable genetic elements and their effect on gene expression; that is, that genes are not fixed like pearls on a string but that they move or "jump" around. McClintock's findings were ignored, partly because the complex development patterns of maize were not as clear to everyone else (especially non-maize geneticists) as they were to her. However, when these findings were confirmed in independent studies of bacteria, she received wide acclaim for her earlier work. McClintock remains the only woman to win an unshared Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.
