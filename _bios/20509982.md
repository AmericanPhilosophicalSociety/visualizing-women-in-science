biography: Hertha Sponer was an accomplished physicist. She was one of the first women to obtain a PhD in physics in Germany and, along with Lise Meitner, one of the first women to gain the right to teach physics at a German university. Although Sponer was not Jewish, she lost her position after the German surrender of power to the Nazis due to prejudice against women scientists. After a brief sojourn in Oslo, Sponer received a position at Duke University in 1936 thanks to the efforts of the Rockefeller Foundation. She remained there until her retirement. Sponer's scientific contributions were primarily in the field of quantum mechanics. She set up a spectroscopy lab at Duke, which allowed her to confirm experimentally several predictions in quantum mechanics.
