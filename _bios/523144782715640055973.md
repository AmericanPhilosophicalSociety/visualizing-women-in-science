A letter dated August 15, 1945 Heilman says "It is necessary for me to quit my job here at the clinic and devote my time to being a housewife. It makes me feel very sad to think of some of the things I wanted to do in the laboratory." In 1955, Heilman writes from Long Beach, CA from the Medical Research Division of the Veteran's Administration Hospital "This is to send you greetings from the West, and to say that I am back in the laboratory again, doing tissue culture studies on immunity." Here she is working under "Dr. Carpenter in the department of Infectious Disesases at UCLA. Then, in 1959, she moves to Washington DC to the Veteran's Administrartion Hospital. In 1960 she writes to Seibert "Your faith in me as a young researcher is one of the very nicest things that has happened to me as a laboratory worker." Series I, Box 3
