biography: Ruby Hirose was an American biochemist and bacteriologist. Her studies focused primarily on blood clotting and thrombin, allergies, and researching cancer using antimetabolites. Hirose earned her undergraduate degree from the University of Washington and completed her doctoral studies at the University of Cincinnati, graduating in 1932. With this accomplishment, Hirose became one of the first Japanese Americans to earn a PhD. She later worked at the University of Cincinnati and the William S. Merrell Company.
