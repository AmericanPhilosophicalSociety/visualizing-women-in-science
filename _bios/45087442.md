biography: "Ruth Sager was an American geneticist. Sager is primarily known for two accomplishments: first, she discovered that genetic traits could be transmitted through chloroplast DNA, the first known example of gene transfer outside of the cell nucleus. Second, she was one of the first people to propose genetic causes for cancer. She received her undergraduate degree in biology in 1938 from the University of Chicago. Then, she attended Rutgers University, earning a master's degree in plant physiology in 1944. She earned her doctorate in maize genetics from Columbia University in 1948. While at Columbia, she worked with Barbara McClintock. After graduation, Sager worked as a researcher at the Rockefeller Institute and Columbia University. She was denied a faculty position until 1966, when she became a professor of biology at Hunter College. Although her research on cytoplasmic genetics was conducted in the 1950s and 1960s, it was largely ignored until the 1970s."
