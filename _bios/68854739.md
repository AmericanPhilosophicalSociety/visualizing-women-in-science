biography: Apprenticed to a millenary establishment at 14, Ida Hyde worked there for seven years while also studying after her tasks were finished to prepare for university. Born to German immigrant parents she first enrolled at the Illinois Industrial University in Champaign. Leaving for financial reasons, she continued to work and save for another seven years, teaching school until she saved enough money to attend Cornell University and graduate in 1891. She then spent time studying at Bryn Mawr and the Woods Hole Marine Biological Laboratory in the summer. She applied to the Heidelberg University in Germany, however, the field she wished to study in, physiology, was not open to women. Physiology professor Wilhelm Kühne jokingly agreed to examine Hyde at the completion of her studies, "if that time should ever come," but when pressured to follow through on his claim, he did not allow Hyde to attend his lectures or work in the laboratory. With Kühne's permission, the male physiologist's assistants helped Hyde and gave her the information required to pass her doctoral examination in 1896. At that point, Kühne then permitted Hyde to work in the laboratory and would go on to recommend her for Heidelberg University's seat at the Naples Zoological Station, which Hyde held in 1896. When she returned to the United States, Hyde presented her idea to hold a chair at the Naples Table for women scientists. The ACA (which became the AAUW in 1921) heard Hyde's request and established The Naples Table Association for Promoting Research by Women. In 1899 Hyde established the physiology department at the University of Kansas where she worked throughout her career. She also invented an underwater microelectrode.
