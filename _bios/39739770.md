notes: 
biography: Kristine Bonnevie researched genetics and embryology. She was a Norwegian biologist and the first woman to receive a PhD in scientific studies and the first woman professor in Norway. She studied medicine at the University of Oslo in 1892 and then shifted focus to zoology and marine biology. She studied in Europe and the US, and in Germany with Theodor Boveri. She finished her PhD in 1906 and then spent two years at Columbia University. In 1910 she returned to Norway to be a professor at Bergen Museum. At the time, women were not allowed to hold positions of office, which professorships were categorized under in Norway, and two colleagues, Georg Sars and Robert Collett, pushed for Norway's Parliament to change the law. In 1912 an act called "Lex Bonnevie" granted women the right to hold positions as professors. She remained a professor at Royal Frederick University until 1937. Later in her career she also studied fingerprints to see if they could determine hereditary connections. She also contributed to the Committee on Intellectual Cooperation at the League of Nations—alongside Marie Curie and Albert Einstein—between 1922 and 1933.
