biography: Nine Choucroun was a French Algerian biochemist. Born in Algeria to a family of tanners, Choucroun was educated in Marseille. She then went to Paris where she worked with Nobel Prize winner Jean Perrin. While in Paris, she director of the <i>Institut de biologie physico-chimique</i> in 1927. She is most well known for helping develop electrophoresis, a process of molecular separation and chemical analysis. In 1940, she left France along with the French government aboard the ocean liner <i>Massilia</i>. She eventually made her way to the United States, where she worked on tuberculosis research, corresponding extensively with Florence Seibert. Later, she returned to France. Today, a prize is awarded in her name to young researchers in physio-chemical biology.
