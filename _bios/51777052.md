biography: Jenny Pickworth Glusker was born in England and earned her bachelor's degree in chemistry in 1953 and doctorate in 1957 from Somerville College, University of Oxford. She is a protein crystallographer, who started graduate work in the laboratory of Dorothy Hodgkin (1910-1994), with the aim of learning how to determine molecular structure by X-ray diffraction. Glusker's work on the hexacarboxylic acid derivative of vitamin B12 revealed the structure of the corrin ring, which significantly contributed to the discovery of the chemical formula of vitamin B12. She was a postdoc at Caltech, and later worked under Lindo Patterson at the Institute for Cancer Research, Philadelphia where she stayed for the remainder of her career. Her research focus has included small-molecule structures related to cancer, the structural aspects of the Krebs cycle and citrates, metal-ion coordination in proteins, the interaction of ligands with metal ions, and the enzymes aconitase and xylose isomerase. She is the recipient of many awards, notably the Fankuchen Award of the ACA and the Garvan Medal of the American Chemical Society. Her many professional contributions include serving as President of the American Crystallographic Association in 1979, Chairman of the US National Committee for Crystallography, and of the International Union of Crystaollography Commission on Crystallographic Teaching, and as editor of Acta Crystallographica D (macromolecules).

description: Mildred Cohn says to "Mrs. Batcheler" "I want to thank you for all the trouble you took to locate Dr. Blake's crystallographic data on 3-Phosphoglycerate kinase. My colleague Dr. Jenny Glusker Brought it back and I am sure it will be most helpful to me." Also, in the "V" folder dated June 1, 1981, Cohn recommends to Sara Vollmer that she ask Dr. Jenny Glusker for a position at the X-ray crystallography lab at the Institute for Cancer Research
