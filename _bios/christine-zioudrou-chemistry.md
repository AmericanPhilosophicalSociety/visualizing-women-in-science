notes: 
biography: Christine Zioudrou was a Greek biochemist. Educated in Thessaloniki and Athens, Zioudrou started her career as a postdoctoral fellow at Yale University, working with Joseph Fruton. She later returned to Greece, working first at the Nuclear Research Center "Demokritos" in Athens, leading a team studying the biochemistry of peptides and proteins, and later as a professor of biochemistry at the University of Crete. Zioudrou also held visiting positions at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel and Michigan State University. Her research focused on peptides with a particular interest in opioid peptides.
