notes: 
biography: Maude Abbott worked in pathology, particularly in heart disease in women and children. She practiced in Montreal and was the first woman to receive a BA from McGill University. She wrote a chapter on congenital heart disease for William Osler's <i>System of Modern Medicine</i> in 1905, and would later found the International Association of Medical Museums with Osler. At the end of her career in 1936 she contributed a new classification of congenital heart disease with her publication of Atlas of Congenital Cardiac Disease. Abbott corresponded with Florence Sabin about positions for young women scientists.
