biography: Esther Breslow is an American biochemist. Breslow had a strong grounding in physical chemistry and received her PhD from New York University in 1959 with a dissertation on synthetic polyribonucleotides. In 1961, Breslow was appointed professor of biochemistry at the Cornell University Medical Center. In her research, Breslow used nuclear magnetic resonance to study protein-ligand recognition and binding on the molecular and thermodynamic level. She was married to chemist Ronald Breslow who credited her expertise and help in his own scientific successes.
