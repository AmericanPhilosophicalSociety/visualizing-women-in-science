notes: 
biography: Priscilla ("Skippy") Lane was an American genetics researcher. Lane was originally trained to teach physical education, teaching the subject in California and and New Hampshire in the 1940s. However, following the death of her husband in World War II, Lane sought out additional education, receiving an MS in Physiology from the University of California Berkeley in 1950. The following year she began working at the Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor, Maine, as a research associate. She became interested in the Bar Harbor Mice and studied tumor formations. Lane worked at the Jackson Laboratory for 56 years and coauthored numerous papers on mouse genetics.
