notes: 
biography: The first female professor in the Netherlands, Johanna Westerdijk researched mosses, fungi, and diseases that affected trees. Westerdijk studied botany at Amsterdam Universit and completed her PhD in Zurich. In 1906, she began to supervise her own laboratory at a phytopathological laboratory in the Netherlands. During her time there, she amassed a massive collection of fungi samples which supplied researchers across the globe. In 1917, she was appointed professor in Utrecht University. Her work primarily concerned diseases affecting trees, and her research helped reduce the spread of disease among plants in the Netherlands. In 1928, the Dutch Federation nominated her for the Ellen Richards Research Prize.She mentored over 50 PhD students, half of whom were women. Throughout the course of her career, she wrote over 60 publications in plant pathology and mycology. Her contributions to plant pathology are also represented in the many fungus species that have been named after her.
