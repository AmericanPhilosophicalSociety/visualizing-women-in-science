notes: 
biography: Albert Einstein was a German Jewish theoretical physicist. Perhaps the most famous scientist of all time, Einstein is known for his articulation of the theory of general relativity. Aside from his scientific achievements, Einstein was also instrumental in securing positions in the United States for scientists displaced by fascism. In 1936, Einstein wrote to Florence Sabin in an attempt to secure a position for the physicist Marietta Blau. He was also involved in Sabin's project to raise money for the Emmy Noether Memorial Fund.
