biography: Pam Batchelor served for many years as the secretary for David Phillips, a well-regarded biophysicist and crystallographer. Though not herself a researcher, she helped provide research data to both Mildred Cohn and Jenny Glusker. Cohn thanks her in two separate notes addressed specifically to her.
