notes: 
biography: Rebecca Lancefield was an American microbiologist. Lancefield worked at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research for nearly her entire career, joining their staff as a research assistant in 1918. Her research concerned the bacterial genus <i>Streptococcus</i>, the members of which cause a range of diseases including strep throat, pink eye, and meningitis. Lancefield's research into streptococci led her to devise a classification system for the bacteria. This system, called the Lancefield grouping, allowed researchers to separate the streptococci that infected humans from those that only affected animals based on the carbohydrate composition of bacterial antigens found on their cell walls. Lancefield held numerous honors. She was the second woman president of the Society of American Bacteriologists and the first woman president of the American Association of Immunologists. She was additionally elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1970. She published more than 50 publications over her 60-year career. During World War II, Lancefield served on the Commission on Streptococcal and Staphylococcal Diseases of the Armed Forces Epidemiological Board.
