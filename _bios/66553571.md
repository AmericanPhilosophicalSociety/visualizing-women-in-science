notes: 
biography: Kathleen Lonsdale was an x-ray crystallographer who is most known for her discovery that the organic molecule benzene is flat. Born in Ireland, she moved to England when she was five. Lonsdale studied at Bedford College and University College London, earning degrees in physics. In 1924, she began working as a crystallographer as a part of William Bragg's team at the Royal Institution. Aside from her discovery of the structure of benzene, she also was one of the first scientists to use Fourier spectral methods to research the structure of matter. In 1945, she became one of the first women to be elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.
