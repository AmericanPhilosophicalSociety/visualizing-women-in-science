notes: 
biography: Audrey Evans was a pediatric oncologist most known for her work with neuroblastoma, a cancer of the nerve tissue that usually affects children under the age of five. Evans was educated in Edinburgh, Boston, and Baltimore. Upon completing her training, she returned to her native England, but had difficulty finding a job on account of sexism in the medical field. She instead went back to the United States and worked in Boston and Chicago before landing a job at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. In 1972, she was appointed a professor of pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania, where she worked with Mildred Cohn, Mary Osbakken, and Elizabeth E. Miller. Evans is called the "mother of neuroblastoma" due to her success in treating this condition. Thanks to her efforts, the rate of mortality due to neuroblastoma has reduced by about 50%. Evans also contributed to the founding of the Ronald McDonald House.
