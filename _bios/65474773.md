notes: 
biography: Beatrice Mintz was a mouse geneticist and cancer researcher. She earned her PhD in zoology from the University of Iowa in 1946, working on amphibian sexual development. In the 1950s and 1960s, she turned her attention to mouse genetics while conducting research at the University of Chicago and the Fox Chase Cancer Center. Mintz was interested in a lethal blood disorder, but the mice embryos were not viable long enough for study. She developed a process for fusing two mice embryos, creating a "chimeric" or allophenic mouse. These fused mice allowed Mintz not only to study the blood disorder, but also to understand how complex organs formed during development. In the 1970s, Mintz used this technique of creating allophenic mice to study cancer. By fusing the embryos of mice susceptible to liver cancer with those of mice that were not, she demonstrated that cancers were grown from a single cell or unit of cells rather than a combination of cells. She also determined that both genetic and epigenetic factors contribute to the development of cancer. In her later years, Mintz experimented with injecting DNA directly into an animal's egg cell, paving the way for later developments in gene therapy.
