notes: 
biography: Evelyn Witkin was a geneticist most known for her work on DNA mutagenesis and repair. Witkin studied biology at Columbia University with Theodosius Dobzhansky, who arranged for Witkin to spend time at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. While there, she began working with <i>E. coli</i> and discovered a UV-radiation resistant variant of <i>E. coli</i>. This sparked her interest in studying the variation in mutations induced in bacteria through exposure to UV radiation. In the early 1970s, Witkin collaborated with Miroslav Radman to discover an SOS response triggered by UV radiation that, under certain conditions, can lead to DNA repair. In addition to her work in science, Witkin was politically active in her youth. She was one of the "Bates Seven," a group of students who protested the exclusion of Black athletes from games played on segregated southern universities. As retribution, her admission to New York University was revoked, leading her to Columbia and Dobzhansky's lab.
