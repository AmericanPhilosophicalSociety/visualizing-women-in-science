notes: 
biography: Ruth Rogan Benerito was an American chemist. Benerito invented a chemical treatment for cotton that allowed for the development of wrinkle-resistant, "wash-and-wear" fabrics. She received a BS in chemistry from Newcomb College and pursued her PhD at the University of Chicago, becoming part of "quite a colony of Newcomb around Chicago" in the words of Rose Mooney-Slater. After receiving her PhD in 1948, she returned to New Orleans, where she worked at Newcomb College, Tulane University, University of New Orleans, and for the USDA. At the USDA, she was a prolific inventor, holding 55 patents over the course of her career.
