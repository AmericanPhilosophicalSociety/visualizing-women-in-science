biography: Maud Slye was an American pathologist and cancer researcher. Slye was among the first scientists to suggest that heritable factors could lead to cancer. Slye received her undergraduate education at the University of Chicago and Brown University. In 1908, she began her graduate work at the University of Chicago, where she remained for the remainder of her career. Slye's legacy is mixed. While she is credited for her discovery of cancer's heritability, she also believed that cancer was passed on through a recessive trait and could be eradicated through breeding. Already during her life, this eugenicist premise caused controversy.
