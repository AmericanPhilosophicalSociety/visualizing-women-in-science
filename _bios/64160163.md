notes: 
biography: Lise Meitner is widely considered one of the most important women scientists of the 20th century. Along with Otto Hahn and her nephew Otto Frisch, she discovered nuclear fission and developed a theoretical explanation the phenomenon. Born into a Jewish family, Meitner was the second woman to receive a doctorate in physics in Austria and worked with Max Planck in Berlin. She collaborated with Hahn for over thirty years, studying radioactive isotopes. In 1938, she was forced to flee and took a position in Stockholm, but faced difficult working conditions due to the misogynistic prejudices she encountered. She met secretly with Hahn in Copenhagen where they conducted the first successful experiments in nuclear fission. Although Hahn led the experiments, Meitner and her nephew worked out the theoretical explanation. Their discoveries became the basis for the Manhattan project, a project Meitner refused to touch out of ethical concerns. In 1945, Hahn was awarded the Nobel Prize for the discovery of nuclear fission, but Meitner's contributions were overlooked. Element 109 was named meitnerium in her honor.

description: Lisa Meitner, Berlin, received Naples Table Association Award, In 1938, Esther Caukin Brannauer writes to the AAUW letting them knw that Meitner is "considered the outstanding woman physicist since the death of Madam Curie" for her work in radioactivity. She is "partly Jewish" and needs to leave Germany.
