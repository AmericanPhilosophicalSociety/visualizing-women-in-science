notes: 
biography: Virginia Livingston was an American physician and cancer researcher best known for her unsupported theory that a certain species of bacteria that she named <i>Progenitor cryptocides</i> was the main cause of cancer in humans. Florence Seibert, Irene Corey Diller and Eleanor Alexander-Jackson were interested in the idea that germs caused cancer and would often correspond with Livingston about her theories. As of today, however, Livingston's theories have not been duplicated by researchers and a clinical trial of her therapy yielded no efficiency in the treatment of cancer. The American Cancer Society did not support Livingston's treatment protocol for cancer and denied her theory of cancer origins.
