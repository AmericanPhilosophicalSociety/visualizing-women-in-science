notes: 
biography: Emmy Noether was a brilliant mathematician. Called "the most significant creative mathematical genius" by Albert Einstein, Noether's mathematical discoveries pushed both mathematic and physics forward. Born in Erlangen, Germany, in 1882, Noether was the daughter of noted German mathematician Max Noether. She was educated at the University of Erlangen and taught there without pay. In 1915, Noether took on a position at the University of Göttingen, also without pay. While she later received a paying position, her career in Germany was cut short when she had to flee on account of being Jewish. She settled in Bryn Mawr, where she continued to teach until her early death in 1935. In physics, she is best remembered for Noether's theorem, which allowed for new developments in classical and quantum physics. In mathematics, Noether is credited with laying much of the groundwork for the development of abstract algebra. Florence Sabin wrote many letters to raise funds for a memorial fund in Noether's name.

description: Emmy Noether, nice obituary written about her by Albert Einstein, Sabin is part of an effort in 1936 to raise a Memorial Fund of $25,000. Sabin describes her life as "It seems that she was the most outstanding mathematician who ever lived. She was dismissed from the University of Goettinghen both because she was a woman and a Jewess and was then invited to Bryn Mawr College when she spent two happy years and then unfortunately died."
