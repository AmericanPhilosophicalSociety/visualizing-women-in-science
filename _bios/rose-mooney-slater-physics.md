notes: 
biography: Rose Camile LeDieu Mooney-Slater was the first woman X-ray crystallographer in the United States. Born in New Orleans, she was educated at Tulane University's Newcomb College, an institution she kept deep ties to throughout her life. She received her PhD from the University of Chicago, then returned to Newcomb College, becoming a professor of physics. In 1943, she worked on the Manhattan Project as a research physicist and crystallographer. She eventually married renowned physicist John Slater and joined him at M.I.T. Mooney-Slater was well regarded in the field of crystallography and published numerous studies on the structure of inorganic compounds. In her papers at the APS, she maintains lifelong connections with other women scientists from Louisiana.

description: Fankuchen mentored RMS. He was a well-known crystollographer and connected British and US-based approaches to crystollography. He sent RMS a congratulation letter when she married John.
