biography: Carol Caperelli is an American biochemist who studies the structure and function of enzymes. She received her PhD from Johns Hopkins University in 1975 and subsequently received a postdoctoral fellowship at Pennsylvania State University. In 1979, she was appointed assistant professor in the department of chemistry at New York University. With the help of Mildred Cohn, Caperelli left NYU in 1986, spending a year at Fox Chase Cancer Center before receiving an appointment as associate professor in the division of pharmacology and medicinal chemistry at the University of Cincinnati College of Pharmacy. Caperelli's research on enzymes has contributed to the understanding to the mechanisms of certain forms of chemotherapy.
