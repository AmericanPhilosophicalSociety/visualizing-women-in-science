biography: Isabel Morgan (also Morgan Mountain) received her PhD in bacteriology from the University of Pennsylvania in 1938. She then studied immunity to the encephalitis viruses as a Fellow, Assistant, and Associate at Rockefeller University (1938-1944). With David Bodian and Howard Howe at the Poliomyelitis Laboratory of the Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health, she worked on the development of a poliomyelitis vaccine as Assistant Professor of Epidemiology (1944-1949). Morgan established in monkeys the level of immune response necessary to protect the nervous system from infection with poliovirus, and developed an experimental vaccine using formalin-inactivated virus. This work was the basis of the Salk polio vaccine, and Morgan is the only woman of 17 persons honored in the Polio Hall of Fame in Warm Springs, Georgia. She was then a Research Associate in Immunology at the Westchester [New York] Department of Laboratories and Research (1950-1953). From 1953-1959 Morgan studied the RNA of poliovirus in chick embryo and tissue culture as Research Associate, then Lecturer, in the Department of Microbiology at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. After training in biostatistics at Columbia (M.S. 1961) she became a Research Associate in Epidemiology at the Public Health Research Institute of New York City (1961-1964) and then at Cornell University Medical College (1964-1969). The later years of her career were spent as a biostatistician Associate of the Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research (1962-1978). She was the daughter of Nobel Prize recipient Thomas Hunt Morgan and the accomplished geneticist Lilian Vaughan Morgan.
