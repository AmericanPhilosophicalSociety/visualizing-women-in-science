biography: "Ruth Gordon was an American bacterial taxonomist. She attended Cornell University and earned a degree in plant bacteriology. Following her degree, she worked at the Division of Soil Microbiology at the United States Department of Agriculture where she studied streptomycetes.She eventually became a professor at the Institute of Microbiology at Rutgers University. While working at Rutgers, she began corresponding with Florence Seibert and Irene Diller. Seibert and Diller isolated several microbes they found in cancer cells and sent them to Gordon for identification. Gordon's prolific work as a cataloger of bacteria has been honored in two ways: the bacterial genus <i>Gordonia</i> and the species <i>Mycobacterium gordonae</i> were named after her."
