notes: 
biography: Patrizia Lopresti held professorships at Northwestern and the University of Illinois at Chicago in the departments of neurology, physiology, biophysics, and psychology. Her most significant scientific contributions have concerned the study of multiple sclerosis. She was a postdoctoral researcher in Mildred Cohn's lab, and Cohn supported her both in her job search and in her applications for permanent resident status in the United States. Lopresti's research has also touched on the cytoskeleton in oligodendrocytes and multiple sclerosis, and she furthered scientific knowledge about cognitive decline in multiple sclerosis.
