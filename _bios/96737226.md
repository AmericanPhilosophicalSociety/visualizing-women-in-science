biography: Henrietta Lacks was a Black woman whose cancer cells are the source of HeLa cell line, the first immortalized cell line and one of the most important cell lines in medical research. Lacks was unknowingly the source of these cells from a tumor biopsied during treatment for cervical cancer at Johns Hopkins Hospital. HeLa cells appear in the network when Irene Diller uses them to draw an image of a tumor. She also writes that she advised a colleague, "I warned him that the cancer cells he was using (HeLa and HEP2) have been transferred so many times through so many laboratories that there is no telling what they may have picked up (August 6, 1963)."
