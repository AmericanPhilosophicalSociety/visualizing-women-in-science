notes: 
biography: June Taylor is an American biochemist and radiologist. She studied molecular biology and biophysical chemistry with Mildred Cohn at the University of Pennsylvania and earned her doctorate in 1969. She went on to hold positions at the University of Maryland, the Fox Chase Cancer Center, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, and the University of Utah School of Medicine. Her published research has focused on numerous applications of magnetic resonance, including enzymes and cancer research.
