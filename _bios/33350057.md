notes: 
biography: Mary Osbakken received her PhD in physiology from Thomas Jefferson Medical College in 1969. She taught for several years at Beaver College (now Arcadia University), but was frustrated with the low pay women received. She returned to academia and received an MD from Temple University. In 1984, she was recruited by Britton Chance to work at the University of Pennsylvania. During her time there, she worked on nuclear magnetic resonance, anesthesia, and cardiology. She left Penn in 1993 to work in the pharmaceutical industry, eventually opening a consulting firm for pharmaceutical companies. She continued to teach on an adjunct basis at Drexel University.
