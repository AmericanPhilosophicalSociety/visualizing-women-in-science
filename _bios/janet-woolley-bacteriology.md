description: Janet McCarter's work at Wisconsin - characterized by Florence Siebert as "good" in a letter to Sabin, January 18, 1944. She works there with a Dr. Williams (male) who "was not conscious until lately that he was responsible for testing some of my products, which always passed thru her hands." Siebert also says, "She has always seemed to be very conscientious in her work." "If she has in mind a logical problem under good guidance I have no doubt she will do a good job. Her interest seems to be in research for I know she was often much discouraged about the amount of teaching she was required to do."
