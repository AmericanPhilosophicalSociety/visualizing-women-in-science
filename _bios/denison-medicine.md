notes: 
biography: Ella Strong Denison was an American philanthropist. Denison maintained a fund to help medical students pay for their educations and corresponded with Florence Sabin about suitable students. Additionally, Florence Sabin mentored her son, Henry Strong Denison. Although Denison was not interested explicitly in promoting women's causes, her fund did promote the work of several women scientists. Marion Hines, Sarah Tower, and Elaine Ralli all had their teaching partially financed by Denison's fund.
