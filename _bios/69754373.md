notes: bio is probably too long but there is so much interesting stuff in her life
biography: Gerty Cori was a pioneering biochemist who was the third woman to win the Nobel Prize in science and the first to receive the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Cori collaborated closely with her husband her whole life and shared the prize with him, as well as Argentinian scientist Bernardo Houssay, for their discovery of the process by which the body stores glycogen and converts it into glucose. Cori faced numerous challenges as a woman of Jewish heritage. As girls' schools did not offer instruction in all subjects at the time, Cori independently studied Latin, physics, chemistry, and mathematics to pass the entrance exams for the medical school of the Charles University in Prague. During her studies, she met her husband Carl, whom she married in 1920, the year of her graduation. Subsequently, they moved to Vienna. However, poor conditions in post-war Europe and increasing antisemitism led them to move to the United States in 1922. After several years at Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo, New York, they began to look for university positions. Her husband received numerous offers, but few universities were willing to hire her as well. In 1931, they both received positions at Washington University in St. Louis, but Cori was offered much less pay than her position. She did not become full professor until 1947, the same year she won the Nobel Prize. Both the metabolic pathway for converting glycogen into glucose (the Cori cycle) and the molecule that catalyzes the process (the Cori ester) are named after Cori and her husband.

description: Cohn notes that Gerty Cori is "the most outstanding" woman chemist who died between 1951-1975. This is for a volume on Notable American Women by Barbara Sicherman. Cohn wrote and researched Cori and seems to view her as a model for female biochemists.
