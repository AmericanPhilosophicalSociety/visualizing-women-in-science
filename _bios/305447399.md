notes: 
biography: Maud Menten was a Canadian biochemist who spent most of her career in the United States. She is most known for her contributions to enzyme kinetics and histochemistry. Educated at the University of Toronto, she graduated with a master's degree in physiology in 1907 and her medical degree in 1911. Between her master's and medical degrees, she spent some time in New York City at the lab of Simon Flexner, working on the effects of radium bromide on tumors. After receiving her medical degree, she left for Berlin, working with Leonor Michaelis on enzyme kinetics. Together, they worked out the Michaelis-Menton equation, which models the rate of enzymatic reactions. Menton then moved to the United States, earning her PhD at the University of Chicago. She would later work at the University of Pittsburgh, remaining there until her retirement in 1950. She also served as a clinical pathologist at the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. She continued to make important contributions to biochemistry, contributing to over 70 publications over the course of her career.
