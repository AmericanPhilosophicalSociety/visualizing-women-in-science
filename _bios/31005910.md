biography: Mary Petermann worked in the field of cellular biochemistry and was a "first" in her field in the numerous roles she held. She received her doctorate at the University of Wisconsin and remained as a postdoctoral researcher until 1945 as the first female chemist staff member. She moved on to cancer research at Sloan-Kettering Institute and became the first female full member there. She also taught biochemistry at Cornell University and became the first full professor in the Graduate School of Medical Sciences. The American Chemical Society awarded her the Garvan Medal in 1966.
