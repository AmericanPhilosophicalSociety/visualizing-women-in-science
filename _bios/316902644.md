biography: Edith Mankiewicz was a German Canadian microbiologist and tuberculosis researcher. Born in Leipzig, she was educated at the University of Leipzig and received her degree in 1933. Although her family had converted from Judaism to Catholicism, she was perceived as Jewish by the Nazi-ruled German government and fled to Lyon. There, she earned an additional medical degree from the University of Lyon. After Germany invaded France, she was again forced to flee, moving to Shanghai in 1941. There, she taught medicine and established a gynecology clinic for victims of sexual assault during the war. Following the war, she moved to Montreal, working first at McGill University and then, starting in 1951, at Royal Edward Chest Hospital. Mankiewicz discovered a method of using yeast cells to speed up the process for producing a tuberculosis diagnosis. Following her work on tuberculosis, she worked on cancer, corresponding with Florence Seibert and her colleagues about a possible fungal or bacterial cause for the disease.
