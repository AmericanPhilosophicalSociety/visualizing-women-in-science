notes: 
biography: Wilhelmina Dunning was an associate in cancer research at the Crocker Special Research Fund. She worked in collaboration with Dr. Maynie Rose Curtis on the development of animal models to study cancer. At the time, in the 1920s, this was a challenging field of study due to a lack of adequate resources. Her work resulted in what is now known as the "Dunning rat", used by researchers to investigate prostate cancer and tumor biology. She retired from Columbia in 1941 when the cancer research center was relocated to the medical school.
