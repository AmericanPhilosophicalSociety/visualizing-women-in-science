notes: 
biography: Martha Ludwig was an American biochemist and crystallographer. Receiving her PhD from Cornell Medical College in 1956, Ludwig was trained in traditional biochemical techniques of studying interactions between proteins. She first learned about x-ray crystallography in 1962 and immediately began using the technique. While working with William Lipscomb, she helped explain the structures of carboxypeptidase A, the first protein structure to be determined in the United States. In 1967, Ludwig received a professorship in Biological Chemistry at the University of Michigan. Here, she researched flavoproteins, elucidating the structure of several compounds.
