notes: 
biography: Marietta Blau was an Austrian physicist who studied rays and high energy nuclear particles. Blau is most famous for developing a method of preparing photographic emulsions that could be used to detect high speed particles. These nuclear emulsions allowed scientists to make new discoveries about cosmic rays. Despite her significance to the history of physics, Blau faced extreme precarity her whole life as a Jewish woman. After graduating from the University of Vienna, she had difficulty securing a stable position and worked several jobs in industry and at various universities. In 1923, she took an unpaid position at the Austrian Academy of Sciences. In 1938, she was force to leave Austria following the German annexation of Austria. Albert Einstein helped secure a position for her in Mexico, but she left for the United States in 1938 due to poor research conditions. There, she joined the US Atomic Energy Commission and worked at several universities. In 1960, she returned to her unpaid position at the Austrian Academy of Sciences due to a medically necessary operation she could not afford to have in the US. She was nominated twice for the Nobel Prize but did not win. In 1950, Cecil Powell won the Nobel Prize in Physics for work done using her methods.
