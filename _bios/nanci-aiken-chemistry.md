notes: 
biography: Nanci R. Aiken received her PhD from the University of New Mexico and assumed a postdoctoral fellowship at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. She worked with Jerry Glickson on oncological imaging and NMR spectroscopy. In 1992, she received an offer from Mildred Cohn to work on a grant-funded project Cohn was pursuing with Audrey Evans and Elizabeth E. Miller; however, it seems she turned down the offer so she could remain in Baltimore. She nonetheless ended up in Philadelphia afterwards, working at the Fox Chase Cancer Center before finally becoming a research assistant professor at the University of Arizona. Aiken left academia to found a charter school in 2000.
