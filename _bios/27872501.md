notes: 
biography: Chemist Ellen Swallow Richards was the first woman to attend MIT and to teach there. She studied first at Vassar College under the guidance of astronomer Maria Mitchell and mathemetician Charles Farrar. While studying chemistry at MIT, she met and married Robert H. Richards, a mining engineer and MIT professor. Ellen Richards began the Women's Laboratory at MIT which operated from 1878-1883. After the closing of the Women's Laboratory, Richards became an instructor at MIT and worked there until the end of her life. Her research interests included water chemistry, industrial chemistry, and applied science. She became well-known in the home economics movement, and published widely on the chemistry of foods, air, water, and how to apply science to everyday life. She introduced the term "ecology" to English-speaking audiences and thought broadly on the health of the natural world. At the end of her life she presented a new theory called euthenics that posited if humans did not clean up the earth's water, air and food, humanity would die out. She was the first woman accepted into the American Institute for Mining Engineers.
