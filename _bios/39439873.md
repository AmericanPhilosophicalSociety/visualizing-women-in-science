notes: 
biography: Elizabeth ("Betty") Armstrong Wood was trained as a geologist at Bryn Mawr and studied at Barnard. At Barnard she studied with A. Lindo Patterson and became interested in crystallography. She was the first woman scientist to work at Bell Laboratories. Along with Patterson, Isidore Fankuchen and William Parrish she founded the American Crystollographic Association (ACA) and in 1957 became the first female president of the ACA. Her clear and accessible writing for the general public helped many understand what crystallography was. In her honor, the ACA also started the Elizabeth A. Wood Science Writing Award.
