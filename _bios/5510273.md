biography: Margaret Green was a geneticist. For nearly two decades, she worked at the Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor, Maine, and compiled comprehensive catalogs of mouse genetics. Green earned her PhD from the University of Iowa in 1940 with a dissertation on grasshopper genetics. The same year, she married Earl Green and would work with him for the rest of her life. Since he was a mouse geneticist, she also began working primarily with mouse genetics. In 1956, her husband was appoointed Director of the Jackson Laboratory, She joined the lab with him a a staff scientist. Green's comprehensive data collection about mouse genetics became the basis for GBASE, the Jackson Laboratory's database for mouse genetics.
