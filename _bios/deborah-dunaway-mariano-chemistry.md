biography: Debra Dunaway Mariano studied biochemistry first at Texas A&M, where she received her PhD, and then at the University of Maryland where she taught until 1996. She then took a position at the University of New Mexico in 1997. She received a strong recommendation from Mildred Cohn when she was considered for the Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellow. Cohn indicated in 1983 that "the quality of her research and productivity is greater than that of most of her contemporaries." She went on to win the award and many other recognitions for her work.
