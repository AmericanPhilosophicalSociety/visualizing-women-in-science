biography: Patricia Nevers is a plant geneticist and professor emerita of biology education. Nevers received her PhD from the University of Freiburg in genetics and worked as a researcher studying plant genetics. After six years of active research, Nevers left academia to teach biology and chemistry at the secondary level in Germany. Later, she returned to academia, researching biology education at the Institute for Science Education at the University of Kiel. Here, she became interested in philosophy, particularly handling bioethical problems in education. In 1994, she was appointed Professor of Biology Education at the University of Hamburg. In this network, Nevers's early connections in plant genetics are represented.
