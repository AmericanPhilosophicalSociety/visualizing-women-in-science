biography: Ethel Dunham focused her work primarily on premature babies and newborns alongside her life partner Martha May Eliot. Dunham became chief of child development at the Children's Bureau in 1935 and established national standards for the hospital care of newborns. She also launched new programs to take hospital healthcare into the homes of new mothers with the help of public health nurses and social workers who followed the progress of babies after their discharge from the hospital. In 1957, the American Pediatric Society awarded her their highest honor, the John Howland Award. She was the first woman pediatrician to receive the award.
