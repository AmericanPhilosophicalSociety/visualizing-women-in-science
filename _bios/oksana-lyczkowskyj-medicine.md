description: half time assistant in Siebert's lab. "She and her husband escaped from Poland just before she was ready to take her final medical examination. Since then she has been doing mainly chemical research and was a most devoted and well thought of assistant on Dr. Connor's project until it was withdrawn. She was offerd a job in the clnic but prefers research and is very interested in this work. I think she would be capable of making the vaccines, of learning to handle the mice, and of doing the histology, since the pathologists would make the diagnoses." in a letter dated April 23, 1970, from FBS to ID. Later, in October 9, 1970, FBS says "Jim and Oksanar are just steaming away. She has now given 4 injections " to mice and is working in the lab well. Oksana goes on to work in Dr. Davis's lab in 1971.
