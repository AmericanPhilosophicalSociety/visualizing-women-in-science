notes: 
biography: Barbara J. Garrison is an American chemist best known for her work on developing computational models for surface reactions. Garrison studied physics at the Arizona State University, but realized her research interests concerned physics at the molecular level. She therefore switched fields and received her PhD in chemistry from the University of California Berkeley in 1975. Since 1979, she has been a professor at Penn State University. She currently is Professor Emeritus in the department of chemistry. Mildred Cohn corresponded with Garrison about a symposium on womenin chemistry at Penn State University.
