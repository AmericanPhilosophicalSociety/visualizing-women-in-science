biography: Martha Tracy was an American medical doctor. She served as dean of the Women's Medical College of Pennsylvania from 1917 to 1940. Tracy studied at Bryn Mawr, the Women's Medical College of Pennsylvania, and Cornell Medical School. Though trained in chemistry, Tracy's research increasingly concerned public health and hygiene. She founded a department of preventative medicine at the Women's Medical College and became the college's first professor of preventative medicine.
