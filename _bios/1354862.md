notes: 
biography: Kate Campbell Hurd-Mead was an obstetrician who promoted the role of women in medicine, including writing one of the first texts on the history of women in medicine. As a student she was mentored by prominent female physicians Mary Putnam Jacobi and Marie Zakrzewska, who both encouraged Hurd-Mead's persistence in medicine. She began a preventative health program at Bryn Mawr. Hurd-Mead then went on to co-found the Evening Dispensary for Working Women and Girls with Dr. Alice Hall, Mary Sherwood, and Lillian Walsh. This became the first institution in Baltimore to employ women physicians and focused on the health issues facing women and girls. Hurd-Mead was also one of the founders and the consulting gynecologist at the Middlesex County Hospital until her retirement in 1925. She was also the president of the American Medical Women's Association. In this capacity, she corresponded with Florence Sabin and several other women in this network to increase the prominence of women doctors.
