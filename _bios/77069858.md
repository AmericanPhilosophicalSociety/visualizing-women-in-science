notes: 
biography: Rhoda Erdmann was a pioneer in cellular biology. Erdmann was one of the first women doctoral students in Germany, earning her PhD in biology in 1908. In 1913, she received a fellowship to conduct research at Yale and subsequently became the first woman member of the Yale Graduate Faculty. She continued her research in the United States until 1918, when anti-German sentiment during World War I led to her imprisonment. She had been accused of poisoning the local water supply and importing viruses. She was then deported and struggled to find work in Germany. Nonetheless, she created a department for experimental cell research at the Charité Hospital in Berlin and helped advance the state of cytology considerably in Germany. In 1933, she was falsely accused of being Jewish and of having helped secure positions for Jewish students. She was jailed again. However, international pressure led to her release. Erdmann is still remembered as one of the most consequential figures in cell biology.
