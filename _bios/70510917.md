biography: Agnes Graham Sanders Riley was an American chemist. She earned her undergraduate degree from Hollins College in 1924 and her MS from the University of Chicago in 1925, with a thesis on oxidation in the amino group diphenylmethylamine. She then became an instructor of chemistry at Newcomb College, where she collaborated with Rose Mooney-Slater. Though Riley was able to continue teaching at Newcomb after her marriage in 1937, she stopped receiving pay. Later in her life, Riley was a prolific genealogist and amateur historian.
