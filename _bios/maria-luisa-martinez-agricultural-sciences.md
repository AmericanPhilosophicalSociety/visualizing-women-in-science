biography: Maria Luísa Martínez worked for the Rockefeller Foundation's Mexico offices in the 1960s. She corresponded with Barbara McClintock about some of the work being done there. Martínez worked as part of the Rockefeller Foundation's Mexican Agriculture Program, an effort to improve agricultural systems in Mexico, increase agricultural yields, and reduce hunger and malnutrition. The efforts of this program also led to improvements in other Central and South American countries, which Martínez may have participated in.
