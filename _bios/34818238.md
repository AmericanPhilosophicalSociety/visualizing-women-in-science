biography: "Janet Howell Clark was an American physiologist and biophysicist. A close friend of Florence Sabin, Clark was a tireless advocate for women scientists. After receiving her PhD from Johns Hopkins in physics in 1914, she initially took a position at Bryn Mawr College. She married Admont Halsey Clark in 1917; however, he died only a year later of Spanish influenza. On his death, Clark received a position at Johns Hopkins in the Department of Physiology. Although not trained in medicine, Clark's expertise in physics proved useful: she studied the effects of light and radiation on human eyesight. In 1938, she became dean of the Women's College at the University of Rochester. Clark and Sabin corresponded frequently about their fellow women scientists, trying to find ways to promote their careers and research. She read applications for the Naples Table Association and even nominated Barbara McClintock for an honorary degree in 1944."
