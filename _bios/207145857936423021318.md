notes: 
biography: Lilian Vaughan Morgan was a biologist working on the genetics of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. Although Morgan only received her first official position at age 76, she made key discoveries in <i>Drosophila</i> genetics, including the discovery of the attached-X and ring chromosomes. Morgan received both her BS and MS from Bryn Mawr College, studying biology under geneticist Thomas Hunt Morgan, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1933. In 1904, she married Morgan and followed him around while he moved between labs. After the birth of her first child in 1906, she took a step back from research to raise the family's children. This sacrifice likely enabled her husband's scientific success. When her children were older, she returned to research, working in her husband's lab. However, the male scientists, including her husband, viewed her with suspicion and only provided her with laboratory space She only received her first official appointment as a Research Associate at the California Institute of Technology after her husband's death in 1945. Despite these challenges, she was a well-regarded geneticist whose name carried weight in the scientific community. Lilian Morgan allowed her name to be used to help Florence Sabin raise funds in honor of Emmy Noether. She was the mother of scientist Isabel Morgan (Morgan Mountain).
