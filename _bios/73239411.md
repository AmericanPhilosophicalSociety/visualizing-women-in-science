notes: 
biography: Lilian Welsh was a physiologist and suffragist. After receiving her MD from the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania, Welsh intended to become a physiological chemistry teacher, however, after not finding a teaching position, she became a physician at Norristown State Hospital in 1890. Welsh joined Mary Sherwood in establishing a private practice in Baltimore Maryland that focused on the health of women and children. Sherwood became Welsh's life-long companion and partner. Later, Welsh and Sherwood ran the Evening Dispensary for Working Women and Girls in Baltimore which was founded alongside Alice Hall and Kate Campbell Hurd-Mead. In 1894 Welsh joined the faculty at Women's College of Baltimore, which became Goucher College. Throughout her life, Welsh worked to combat tuberculosis and improve women's health and hygeine. She was also involved in the National American Women's Suffrage Association. Her impact on women's education and the physiology program at Goucher leave numerous traces in this network. Lilian Welsh was also the primary reviewer for applications to the Naples Table Association. Together with Florence Sabin, Welsh reviewed all applications for the Naples Table and Ellen Richards Research Prize from at least 1915, if not earlier, until the association's dissolution in 1932.
