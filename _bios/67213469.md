notes: 
biography: Marcella Boveri was an American biologist. She was the first woman to graduate with a degree in biology from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1882. In the 1890s she was admitted to study science at the University of Würzburg in Germany where she met and fell in love with her soon to be husband Theodor Boveri, who incidentally initially opposed women working in science. The Boveris would continue to work together in science, however Marcella’s husband’s name received the credit for their collaborative work.
