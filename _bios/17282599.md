biography: Maxine Singer is a pioneer in the field of biology. Her research on nucleic acids provided previously unforeseen pathways to understanding diseases and their treatments. She also has been on the forefront of ethical debates surrounding biology; she was an organizer of the 1975 Asilomar conference about the risks in recombinant DNA research and is a member of the Board of Governors and Scientific Advisory Council of the Weizmann Institute of Science, The Human Genome Organization, the National Academy of Sciences, and the Pontifical Academy of Sciences. She was awarded the Distinguished Presidential Rank Award from Reagan in 1988, the National Medal of Science in 1992, and the Public Welfare Medal. She served as the president of the Carnegie institute for 14 years. Additionally, she has developed programs to improve K-12 science curriculum.
