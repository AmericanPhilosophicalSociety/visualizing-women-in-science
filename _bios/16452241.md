notes: 
biography: Microbiologist Alice Catherine Evans investigated dairy products, specifically milk and cheese, to find that the disease brucellosis—known at the time as Malta Fever or undulunt fever—, which caused miscarriages in mammals, came from a bacteria in cow's milk. Her findings advocated that milk be pasteurized to protect consumers from bacteria. Evans contracted undulunt fever in 1922 and remained sensitive to brucellosis, which halted her work. In 1928 she became president of the Society for American Bacteriologists, the first woman to hold the position. She was awarded honorary doctoral degrees from Women's Medical College of Medicine, the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Wilson College.
