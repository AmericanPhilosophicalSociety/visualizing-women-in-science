biography: Rita Levi-Montalcini did revolutionary research in neuroembryology, despite the overwhelming obstacle of living as a Jewish woman in fascist Italy. She spent parts of the 1930s in hiding and was unable to work in a university lab as a result of Mussolini's Race Laws; however, she refused to give up her research and set up a small lab inside her bedroom. After the war, she was recruited to work as a doctor before returning to lab work. At Washington University in Saint Louis, Missouri, she discovered Nerve Growth Factor, which opened many doors for the treatment of cancer, dementia, multiple sclerosis, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's. Alongside Stanley Cohen, Levi-Montalcini won the 1986 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the discovery of nerve growth factor. She was dedicated to ensuring that other scientists would have the resources and support they needed, so she founded and directed the Institute of Cell Biology, founded the European Brain Research Institute, and established the Rita Levi-Montalcini Foundation to help support the education of African women. She was also elected to hold a lifelong Senate position in Italy in 2001.
