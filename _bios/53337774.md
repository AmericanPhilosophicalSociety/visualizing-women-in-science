notes: 
biography: Franca Podo is an Italian physicist cell biologist. Podo specializes in nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and imaging and has used it to study breast cancer and the progression of tumors. Podo earned her degree in physics in Rome in 1967 and began her lifelong career at the Istituto Superiore di Sanità (ISS). In 1971, she received a fellowship to study at Rockefeller University in the lab of George Nemethy. During her time in the United States, she sought out contact with Mildred Cohn and joined Cohn's lab in 1972. She returned to Italy the following year, where she continued her career at ISS. Podo has served as research director at ISS and the director of the section for physical biochemistry at ISS.
