notes: 
biography: Nina Fedoroff is an American molecular biologist known for her research in life sciences and biotechnology, particularly transposable elements or jumping genes and plant stress response. After graduating from Rockefeller University she joined the faculty at UCLA where she conducted research in nuclear RNA. In 1978, she moved to the Carnegie Institution for Science in Maryland where she worked on developmental biology in the Department of Embryology where she pioneered DNA sequencing and worked out the nucleotide sequence for the first complete gene. In 1978, she also joined the faculty of the Johns Hopkins University Biology department where she worked on the molecular characterization of maize transposable elements. In 2007, President George W. Bush awarded her the National Medal of Science.
