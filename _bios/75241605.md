notes: 
biography: Dorothy Wrinch was a British mathematician who applied mathematical concepts to the study of biochemical compounds. She was educated at Cambridge, Univeristy College London, and Oxford. At Cambridge, she studied symbolic logic with Bertrand Russell. In 1929, she was the first woman awarded a D.Sc. degree from Oxford. Starting in 1931, Wrinch became interested in biochemistry and applied mathematics to the study of the structure of chromosomes and proteins. Her theories received negative attention from Linus Pauling, who publicly attacked her theories. This made it difficult for her to advance her career. Nonetheless, she moved to the United States in 1939 and ended up teaching at Smith College, Amherst College, and Mount Holyoke College.
