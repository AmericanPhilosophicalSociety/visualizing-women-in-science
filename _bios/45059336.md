notes: 
biography: Jean Macnamara was an Australian medical doctor. After studying medicine at the University of Melbourne, she received a position at the Royal Children's Hospital in 1923. She was almost passed over for the position since the hospital contained no women's restrooms at the time. Macnamara conducted research on polio and worked towards the identification of different strands of the polio virus. This paved the way for the development of the polio vaccine. Macnamara traveled in England and the United States on a fellowship from the Rockefeller Foundation, and it was in this capacity that she came into contact with many of the scientists in this network.
