biography: Christianna Smith was an American zoologist. In 1915, she graduated from Mount Holyoke College with a degree in mathematics and zoology. She then studied zoology at Cornell University, earning an MA in 1920 and a PhD in 1923. Smith went on to have a long career at Mount Holyoke, teaching zoology there until her retirement in 1958.
