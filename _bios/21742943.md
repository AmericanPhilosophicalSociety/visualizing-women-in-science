notes: 
biography: Martha May Eliot was a pediatrian public health advocate. She also served as assistant director for the WHO. Eliot studied at Bryn Mawr College, where she met Ethel Dunham. Dunham and Eliot spent the rest of their lives together in a domestic and romantic partnership. After graduation, both Dunham and Eliot enrolled in Johns Hopkins Medical School, graduating in 1918. Eliot's early work concerned rickets. Later, she advocated for important policies related to maternal and infant health as part of New Deal-era health reforms. In 1964, the American Public Health Association established the Martha May Eliot Award in recognition of her efforts in improving public health measures for mothers and their children.
