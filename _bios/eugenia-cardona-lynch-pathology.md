biography: Eva Cardona Lynch worked with Florence Seibert in her lab at Henry Phipps and went on to become a physician at the Department of Pathology, Sanatorio Hospital "Dr. Manuel Gea Gonzalez" in Mexico. She recommended that Eva Soto Leake reach out to Florence Seibert to study with her at the Henry Phipps Institute. Lynch died shortly after introducing Eva to Seibert and Lynch's plans for efforts to combat tuberculosis with Eva Soto Figueroa ended. Lynch and Leake were very close, having been friends for ten years and having worked in the lab together.
