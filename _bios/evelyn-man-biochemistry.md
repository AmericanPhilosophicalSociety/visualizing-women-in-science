notes: 
biography: Evelyn Man was an American biochemist known for developing the first test to detect hormone levels in the thyroid gland. Man's career was largely at Yale University, where she worked first as a technician, then a researcher, and eventually a professor. In 1961, Man left Yale and continued her research at Brown University, where she discovered that infants with low hormone levels in the thyroid gland would later develop a cognitive disability as children. She also studied the effects of nuclear radiation on the thyroid gland in Japanese survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In 1976, Man was awarded the American Thyroid Association's Distinguished Service Award and the United Cerebral Palsy Award for her research. Throughout her life she published over 150 research papers.
