notes: "Spanish name: Consuelo Vadillo Gutierrez"
biography: Consuelo Vadillo Gutierrez was from Mérida, Yucatan, Mexico. Her father was a physician and in 1930 received a degree of Physician, Surgeon and Obstetrician in 1930 from the National University of the Southeast, Merida. She came to the United States to study gynecology and was awarded a $1500 fellowship from the American Association of University Women in 1934. According to letters of recommendation that supported her application, she was "the first woman doctor" in Yucatan. She is described as "a very feminine type of woman, small, gentle and retiring." Additionally, in her practice in Mexico she "receives many cases which have never before had treatment because of the existing prejudice against women receiving treatment from male doctors." Vadillo first engaged in a period of observation at Johns Hopkins University and then took up operative gynecology at Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania.

description: Consuelo Vadillo, from Marida, Yucatan, Mexico, a gynecologist, who goes on to Women's Medical College at Philadelphia based on Sabin's recommendation. See the letter from her in the Heloise Brainerd, 1934 file. Brainerd is not a scientist, but associated with the Pan American Union. Also interesting is that Vadillo is able to do this post graduate study because she received a $1500 scholarship from the AAUW, who for this year awards five to US women, one to Europe and one to South America. Dr. Vadillo is the only woman physician in the Yucaton, daughter of a physician there. See also the article by Lillian Estelle Fisher, "The Influence of the Present Mexican Revolution upon the Status of Mexican Women" The Hispanic American Historical Review (1942), page 225. Ironically, it seems Sabin first doubt Vadillo's trianing in 2/1/34 letter to Kathryn McHale, Series I, Box 14
