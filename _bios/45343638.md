description: Dr. Lydia Edwards, Tuberculosis Program, Department of Health, Education and Welfare, Public Health Service, corresponds with Seibert extensively in 1940-50s. In this folder (Lydia Edwards) is a letter from Edward Krohn, JHU, talking about testing of African American TB patients in Freedman's Hospital in Washington DC. It seems that Edwards is involved with this testing and runs a study of a couple thousand African Americans where they test the solution of injections on these patients with TB at the Freedman's Hospital.
