biography: Irene Corey Diller worked on cancer research and published on fungi found in cancer cells in animal tissue. Along with her mentor, Florence Seibert, Diller pursued the hypothesis that a fungus or bacterium was the cause of cancer. Diller became a central node in Seibert's network and frequently commented on other women in science within her letters. Irene Diller married William F. Diller, biology professor at University of Pennsylvania, and they published together throughout their lives.
