biography: Jane ("Janey") Park was an American biophysicist. Park's research focused on using NMR and NMR spectroscopy for studying biological processes, such as enzyme production and metabolic abnormalities in muscle diseases. Park received her PhD at Washington University in St. Louis in 1952. In St. Louis, Park studied with Gerty Cori and collaborated with Mildred Cohn. In 1953, Park received a position at Vanderbilt, where she would remain for the rest of her career. Park is particularly known for her work on the compound glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, which, according to Mildred Cohn, "had a great influence on the whole area of enzyme mechanism."
