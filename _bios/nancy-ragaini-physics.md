biography: Nancy Ragaini served as a research assistant in Rose Mooney-Slater's lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the 1960s. Ragaini was responsible for obtaining and processing data, setting up the lab experiments, and monitoring and maintaining equipment. She continued to perform these duties after Mooney-Slater moved to Florida in 1965, essentially running the lab independently. Ragaini worked at MIT while her husband, Richard C. Ragaini, was completing his PhD in chemistry.
