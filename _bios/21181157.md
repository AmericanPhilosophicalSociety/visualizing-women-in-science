notes: 
biography: Linda Powers is an American biophysicist. Powers was a pioneer in x-ray absorption spectroscopy. After receiving her PhD in physics from Harvard University in 1976, Powers worked in Britton Chance's laboratory at the University of Pennsylvania. She worked simultaneously at AT&T Bell Laboratories, spending more time there as she only ever achieved an adjunct position at Penn. In 1988, she received her first full-time academic job, taking a position at Utah State University. In 2007, she was appointed the Thomas R. Brown chair in bioengineering at the University of Arizona. Her more recent work focuses on microbe detection and developing sophisticated instruments for that purpose.
