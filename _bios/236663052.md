biography: Charity Waymouth was an English tissue culturist and biochemist. Educated in England and Scotland, Waymouth moved to the United States in 1952 to work on cancer research at the Roscoe B. Jackson Memorial Library. Waymouth would remain at the Jackson Laboratory until her retirement in 1982. During her time there, she served as Director of Research, Director of Training, and Interim Director. Waymouth founded the Tissue Culture Association and was an active researcher in the fields of cell metabolism and normal and malignant growth. Waymouth developed the chemically defined medium known as Waymouth's medium, which is used to study nutrition, metabolism, and grown in mouse cells.
