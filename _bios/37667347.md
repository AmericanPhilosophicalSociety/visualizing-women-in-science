notes: 
biography: Annie Jump Cannon was a prolific classifier of stars. She classified 350,000 in her lifetime, primarily during her work as a "computer" at Harvard. She also developed the Harvard spectral system. She was a suffragist and was voted one of the 12 greatest living women in America by the National League of Women Voters. The first woman to receive a PhD in astronomy from Groningen University, she was the first woman to win an honorary degree from Oxford. She was also the first woman to win the Henry Draper Medal of the National Academy of Sciences and to become an officer in the American Astronomical Society where she established the Annie Jump Cannon Award, which would later be given to Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin.
