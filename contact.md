We view this project as a starting point for a larger conversation about the history of women in science and also the lives and accomplishments of the individual women we feature. In many cases, our knowledge about these women and their contributions to science is incomplete. Additionally, there may be other connections between women scientists lurking in other sources that we have not considered. We hope you will fill out the following survey to let us know your feedback on the project! If you would like to get in touch to provide additional information on a woman scientist in the network or to discuss a possible collaboration on an expanded network, please reach out to us directly at [digitalprojects@amphilsoc.org](mailto:digitalprojects@amphilsoc.org).
